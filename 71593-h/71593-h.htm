<p class='c002'>The Aztecs of Mexico were accustomed to use these insects to light them
through the forests by night. Fastening them to their hands and feet,
they passed flaming along. It is said that the Mexicans still use them for
this purpose. The fire beetle is shown to the left of this inscription.</p>

<p class='c014'>“The natural system”—A middle course—Neuropterous insects—White
ants and their ways—Kings and queens—A royal diet—Secondary
majesties—Soldiers and workers—Ant invaders—Methods
of warfare.</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_0_4 c015'>IF there is any plan in this little book it will, no doubt,
appear in time to its readers, but I myself am only
quite clear as to this, that, not being of a scientific
nature, it will not include a definition of an insect. Why
should it? Everybody knows what he thinks an insect is,
and those who may be willing to have their ideas on such
a fundamental subject disturbed will rightly consult some
work of greater authority than this can pretend to. So
instead of worrying myself, and others, about what insects
really are, or what are not really insects, as, for instance,
spiders, centipedes, scorpions, and the like, all which I
propose to include in my tale—should they happen to present
themselves—I shall confine myself to saying something
about what some insects do, and I shall let one suggest
<a id='Page_14'></a>and lead to the discussion of another, quite at haphazard,
and without any attempt at system or classification whatever.
This, in fact, is my own idea as to what is “the
natural system,” and the only trouble about it is knowing
where to begin, because, as there are some 300,000 known
insects,<a id='r1'></a><a href='#f1' class='c016'><sup>[1]</sup></a> and any one of them will do as well to start from
as any other, there is a great <i><span lang="fr">embarras de richesses</span></i>. In
such cases the usual thing to do is to take either the head
or the tail of the series—to commence with the <i><span lang="la">Hymenoptera</span></i>,
which include the highest and most intelligent forms,
such as the ants and bees, or else with the <i><span lang="la">Collembola</span></i> or
<i><span lang="la">Thysanura</span></i>, which are understood to contain the lowest.
I shall not adopt either of these methods. The <i><span lang="la">Neuroptera</span></i>,
as far as I can make out (and if they don’t it doesn’t
matter), stand somewhere about the middle, and with
them accordingly—as being between the two extremes—I
decide to break ground. Having done so, as I said
before, I may go anywhere—absolute freedom will be
mine. Like Plato, I can follow the argument whithersoever
it leads; inspired with which reflection I hasten to
begin it.</p>

<p class='c017'>Though the order of neuropterous—which, by the
way, means nerve-winged—insects does not contain any
ants, yet the so-called white ants or termites—which are
very like ants in their ways, and almost, or quite, as
interesting to talk about—are included in it. They are
commonest in tropical or, at any rate, very hot countries,
such as Africa, Australia, and South America, and here
the conical, or dome-shaped structures, made of red earth,
which they erect above the surface of the ground, and
which contain the greater part of the nest, are of such
dimensions as to take a very prominent part in the features
of the landscape. Often they are covered with vegetation,
including bushes, or even small trees, on which, in Africa,
antelopes are accustomed to browse. In Australia there
is no reason, that I can see, why kangaroos should not, at
least upon the grass which must often clothe them, and
which is their staple of food.</p>

<p class='c002'>These great mounds are made by the white ants, and contain their
nests; but large and strong as they are, the ant-eater breaks them
down and devours the ants. A queen white ant is shown at the
right-hand corner with the extraordinary development in which
the eggs are carried.</p>

<p class='c015'><a id='Page_15'></a>These great mounds are pierced in every direction with
innumerable galleries, leading to and from the various
cells and chambers in which the domestic economy of the
white ants is principally performed, one of which, known
as the royal cell, contains the king and queen, and is
situated beneath all the others. Not all white ants, however—for
there are several species—are governed or presided
over in this way. Grassi, who studied them in Sicily,<a id='r2'></a><a href='#f2' class='c016'><sup>[2]</sup></a>
declares that the whole of the Termitidæ, whether belonging
to Southern Europe or the still hotter countries from
which they have, no doubt, been unknowingly imported,
fall into two primary types. In the first of these the
colony is presided over by a king and queen, representing
the fully developed male and female forms, which have
once, unlike the workers and soldiers—for, like ants, these
insects are divided into castes—possessed fully developed
wings, which they have subsequently got rid of in the
same way that the queen ant does hers. In the second
type the colony possesses several kings and queens, but
<a id='Page_16'></a>these, though they marry and produce offspring, are not
perfect males and females, and never possess wings. They
are, in fact, produced artificially by the working termites,
just as the hive-bees are able to make themselves a new
queen—should they require one—by feeding an ordinary
worker with royal jelly, and by a method somewhat similar
though not precisely the same, the royal substitutes
being fed, not on any extraneous substance, but on a
salivary fluid secreted by the workers themselves—saliva,
in fact. The colony, however, is, in this case, not founded
by the royalties thus bred up, but by a portion of a pre-existent
colony which, migrating from the parent nest,
takes this method of augmenting its numbers.<a id='r3'></a><a href='#f3' class='c016'><sup>[3]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c017'>In the termite nest, as amongst ants, all members work
for the good of all. The soldiers, which are furnished
with large heads and long scythe-like jaws, take upon
themselves the duties of attack and defence, though in
some species they only do so when the enemy is of a
formidable nature, leaving unimportant foes to their less
specialised companions. These are equal to such inglorious
tasks, but when the colony is invaded by hostile members
of their own race, or by some fierce ant enemy, they retreat
into the inner recesses, leaving the danger and honour to
others. Such an enemy is <i><span lang="la">Cremastogaster scutellaris</span></i>—or
call him Cremas—who, though never invaded by the
white ants, enters their nest—or termitary, to use the
learned word—intent upon massacre. Under such circumstances
“the soldiers place themselves, with gaping
mandibles, waiting for any ant that may come within
reach. They then snap their jaws rapidly, shearing off
<a id='Page_17'></a>antennæ and legs, tearing the abdomen, or even cutting
the ants in two. The soldiers’ mandibles are seen to act
like extremely sharp shears.”<a href='#f3' class='c016'><sup>[3]</sup></a> This should be somewhat
discouraging for the ants, and, indeed, they seem rather
shy of the soldiers, avoiding their heads, and “only daring
occasionally to attempt to lop off their mandibles.” Their
more considered method, which they adopt whenever
practicable, is to approach them from behind, and bite
their abdomens, the soldiers, on their part, endeavouring
to protect this vulnerable portion—and it is a fairly large
one—of their anatomy by creeping backwards under pieces
of wood or stones, from which the head, with its murderous
jaws, is alone allowed to project.</p>

<p class='c017'>In these encounters the advantage does not seem to lie
so decidedly with the ants as to explain their conduct in
making the invasion, since peace, according to Professor
Grassi’s observations, is usually concluded “after about
an hour’s conflict, with a certain number of killed and
wounded on both sides.”<a href='#f3' class='c016'><sup>[3]</sup></a> As a result, however, it would
appear that the ants often remain in possession of a portion
of the nest, whilst the original occupants have to be
contented with what remains. If this, therefore, is their
object, the invaders have carried the day, but if, as seems
likely under natural conditions, they should prefer to
return to their own home, they can hardly be said to
have done so. Information seems wanting on these
points.</p>

<p class='c017'>As with ants, war is also waged between the various
species of Termitidæ. <i><span lang="la">Termes lucifuga</span></i>, for instance—for
where there is no English name there is nothing for it
<a id='Page_18'></a>but to speak Latin—is, though much smaller, a terrible
enemy of <i><span lang="la">Calotermes</span></i>. The soldiers of the latter can,
indeed, without much difficulty, cut their own in two,
but their greater activity is often more than a match for
the superior strength of their opponents. The workers
are more easily disposed of, but with these the soldiers of
<i><span lang="la">Calotermes</span></i> do not often concern themselves. They are
left to the nymphs<a id='r4'></a><a href='#f4' class='c016'><sup>[4]</sup></a> and larvæ, the equivalents, with the
latter species, of a true worker caste which has not yet
been developed amongst them, as it has with others of the
family. When Professor Grassi placed a worker of Termes
in one of his Calotermite tube-nests<a id='r5'></a><a href='#f5' class='c016'><sup>[5]</sup></a> it was at once placed
<i><span lang="fr">hors de combat</span></i> by a nymph (somewhat a shrewish one) of
the latter, which, rushing upon it, cut off a portion of its
mouth. Other nymphs, as well as several large larvæ,
then hurried up and proceeded to further the good work
by severing the unfortunate creature’s legs, and tearing
open its abdomen. In all this the soldiers took no part
until one, towards the end of the struggle, advanced and
added his single bite to those which had been so plentifully
bestowed. Similar observations were made upon various
other occasions, from which it appears plain that, as before
remarked, the soldiers of this—very probably of all the
termites—are accustomed, purposely, to reserve their
strength for foemen worthy of their steel.</p>

<p class='c017'>It will be seen from the above account that termites
<a id='Page_19'></a>differ from true ants in one very important particular,
namely, that they are as active and free-moving in the
larval and pupal states as in the mature, or imago, one.
“The termite society,” indeed, “consists, for the most
part, of wingless sexually immature individuals, children
potentially of both sexes, which do not grow up.”<a id='r6'></a><a href='#f6' class='c016'><sup>[6]</sup></a> Out
of the majority of these the worker caste, when it exists,
is formed, whilst a much lesser number develop into the
large-headed, long-jawed soldiers. Both of these castes,
apparently, are produced independently of sex, that is to
say, they are potentially either males or females, and not
composed exclusively, as is the case with ants and bees, of
undeveloped females. Only the genuine king and queen
of the termitary would seem to have attained the true
imago state; such substitute royal forms as the workers, by
feeding the larvæ with saliva, are able to produce, retaining
larval characteristics, though sexually mature—a phenomenon
scientifically known as <i><span lang="la">neoteinia</span></i>. As with the
bees, these potential future royalties are bred up by the
working termites to meet possible future emergencies.
They are never allowed to leave the nest, and, should any
accident befall the reigning king and queen, a pair of
them are chosen to rule and produce offspring.</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_0_4 c015'><span class='sc'>It</span> used to be supposed that such communication as
ants are capable of holding with one another took
place entirely, or almost entirely, through the mutual
stroking of the antennæ, and Sir John Lubbock (now
Lord Avebury) was unable to satisfy himself, after
numerous experiments, that they could either hear or
utter any sound. It is now known, however, that not
only can some ants emit various sounds at their pleasure—as,
indeed, is sufficiently obvious in the case of one or two
species—but also that they possess special structures
enabling them to do so, and the existence of which is
inconceivable, except on the supposition that they both
hear and attach a meaning to the notes thus evolved.
Thus at a meeting of the Entomological Society held in
the year 1893, Dr. David Sharp (author of the “Insects”
portion of <i>The Cambridge Natural History</i>) declared
that “examination revealed the existence in ants of the
most perfect stridulating or sound-producing organs yet
discovered in insects, these being situated on the second
<a id='Page_21'></a>and third segments of the abdomen in certain species.
The sounds produced were of the greatest delicacy, and it
appeared doubtful whether the microphone would be able
to assist the human ear in their detection”—which, indeed,
it has not yet done.<a id='r7'></a><a href='#f7' class='c016'><sup>[7]</sup></a> Later, in the work above
mentioned, Dr. Sharp remarks, “In many ants these
parts”—that is to say the abdominal segments—“bear
highly developed stridulating organs, and the delicacy and
perfection of the articulations allow the parts to be
moved, either with or without producing stridulation.”<a id='r8'></a><a href='#f8' class='c016'><sup>[8]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c017'>As these ant utterances are not sufficiently loud to be
audible to our human ears, they must, I suppose, be
inferred from the existence of the organs above-mentioned,
and the way in which they work; but this is surely
sufficient data to go upon, since it is hardly possible for
one hard substance to grate upon another silently. Forel,
accordingly, as well as Janet and other observers, now
believe sound to be one of the principal means by which
ants hold converse with each other, and it is interesting
to find that Grassi and Sandias have arrived at the same
conclusion in regard to white ants, or termites. Their
opinion, together with the facts upon which it has been
founded, is thus expressed:—</p>

<p class='c017'>“Several writers have mentioned the convulsive movements
characteristic of Termites. These movements, or
quiverings, are easily observed in Calotermes, and may be
repeated periodically at very short intervals, almost at
the frequency of the pulse-rate. In the act of quivering,
the legs are held motionless, whilst the body is shaken
forwards and backwards. Sometimes a white ant may
<a id='Page_22'></a>stop, whilst running, in order to quiver one or more
times. Occasionally these convulsive movements are
repeated a few times only, and then stop altogether; but
at other times they recur after a few seconds’ or, at most,
a few minutes’ rest, and may thus be continued, sometimes,
for hours, at regular or irregular intervals. In the
intervals between successive convulsions the insect
remains still, or progresses for a short distance only.
These movements are executed by all members of the
colony except the newly hatched ones. I have satisfied
myself,” continues Professor Grassi, “by careful observation
of the phenomena exhibited in tube-nests, that these
convulsions serve as a cry to summon help or give alarm,
or as a lament: in short as a mode of intercommunication.”<a id='r9'></a><a href='#f9' class='c016'><sup>[9]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c017'>The same observers then go on to tell us that if white
ants are disturbed in any sudden way, as by the too rough
shaking of their nest, or by a light being suddenly flung
upon it, or if otherwise annoyed, “all the members of the
colony begin to quiver, except those that are running
briskly about in search of a better situation.”<a href='#f9' class='c016'><sup>[9]</sup></a> When
dying, too, they will sometimes quiver in this way, at
intervals of a few minutes, for as much as an hour or two,
or even longer. Should an enemy—such as those we have
been speaking of—be introduced of a sudden into the
nest, the less valiant members of it prefer to run away,
but in the midst of their retreat they may often be seen
to stop and quiver with unusual energy. Their object in
these cases seems to be to raise a general alarm, nor is it
long before they are successful. Again, if whilst one
<a id='Page_23'></a>insect is burrowing into wood another outside should
quiver in this way, the burrower quickly comes out, as
though in response to some signal of alarm. From all
this it seems evident that these curious movements must
be accompanied by some sound, or sounds, inaudible to our
human ears, and perhaps having a varied range, and with
considerable power of modulation. To produce them,
however, some stridulating or other organs would seem to
be necessary, and of these, though they must, if there,
be visible under the microscope, Professor Grassi says
nothing. Possibly, however, sounds may be produced by
the rubbing together of various parts of the body without
any special apparatus having been developed, in which
case the language, if we may call it so, cannot be so rich
or copious.</p>

<p class='c017'>The above remarks apply more especially to the larger
of the two white ants of Southern Europe. In regard to
the smaller one, Professor Grassi makes the following
interesting remarks: “Termes makes the same convulsive
movements as does Calotermes, but the soldier of this
species is able to produce a special creaking sound, which
arises, whenever the head is held horizontally, during the
act of quivering, by friction between the back of the head
and the front part of the thorax. But whenever the
head, during this act, is held in the usual position, which
is not quite horizontal, no perceptible sound is produced,
owing to the absence of such friction. The soldiers of
Termes, therefore, possess two distinct modes of communication,
whilst those of Calotermes have only one, in
which no perceptible sound is produced. This characteristic
<a id='Page_24'></a><i><span lang="la">crepitus</span></i>,” continues the Professor, “may be heard, at
frequent intervals, by applying the ear to a tube containing
a nest of Termites. This proves that the quivering
motions are a constant feature in undisturbed nests, so
that they cannot be employed only as signals of alarm or
distress. I conclude, therefore, that besides such special
significations these convulsive movements must also have
the value of ordinary speech; that they constitute, in
short, a means of intercommunication. The same conclusion
holds good for Calotermes (the one we have
hitherto been talking about), and I imagine that the
quivering of both species produces a sound which is perceptible
to the insects themselves, but inaudible to the
human ear.”<a href='#f9' class='c016'><sup>[9]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c017'>Members of the same ant community are known to
recognise each other, and this is no less the case with the
white ants, or termites. Thus when a few of the latter
were removed from the termitary and returned to it after
five or six hours, the population showed no signs of alarm—not
scurrying wildly about as they would have done
had strangers been introduced—but remained quiet and
orderly. It was objected, however, though I cannot see
the force of such an objection, that the exiles, on their
return, would have instantly recognised their old nest, and
thus, knowing exactly where to go and what to do, they
would have created no disorder, and consequently roused
no suspicion, amongst the other members of the colony.
To meet this theory Professor Grassi provided one of his
colonies with a new nest from which he excluded a certain
number of individuals, so that when these were introduced
<a id='Page_25'></a>into it, an hour or two after their companions had settled
down in their fresh abode, it was, of course, quite unfamiliar
to them. In spite of this, however, they caused
no disturbance, but were clearly recognised as friends.
When, however, a few strangers of the same species were
introduced, they created great alarm amongst the rightful
proprietors, who scattered in all directions. In a little
while, however, all was again quiet, and as no fighting was
observed, it would appear that, amongst the termites,
strangers from different nests soon become friendly with
one another. This, however, applies to the commoners
only, it is not the same where royalty is concerned. Thus
when a second king and queen were introduced into a
termitary already provided with a pair, they were at once
attacked by the subjects of the latter, who loyally bit off
their legs. Two days afterwards the reigning queen was
herself seen to attack the male pretender, or rather unfortunate
victim of scientific curiosity. He, however,
though without legs to assist him, managed to drag
himself away, but was afterwards found dead, with the
outraged queen nibbling vindictively at his mutilated
stumps. Next day the stranger queen was also found
dead, and the same thing always happened whenever the
experiment was repeated. Sometimes, indeed, the supernumerary
royal pair, or pairs, had disappeared altogether,
from which it seems clear that they must have been not
only killed, but eaten.</p>

<p class='c017'>Cannibalism, indeed, is rather an institution than a vice
in the termitary. To begin with, the cast skin of every
member is eaten by the others as a matter of course. With
<a id='Page_26'></a>this view, any individual who is ready to moult receives
the skilled aid of two or more assistants, who either eat
the outer portion of their friend, bit by bit, as they shred
it off, or else carry it away whole and devour it at their
leisure. Sometimes, moreover, one, after licking another
affectionately, in the way that ants do, may be seen to give
it a covert bite, as though desirous of something more
filling, whilst any sick member is eaten by its companions
before it is dead. Royalty is not exempt from this treatment,
and, on one occasion, nine individuals, including one
soldier, were observed by Professor Grassi in the act of
enjoying a meal on the body of a substitute king who was
in process of moulting. The wretched animal was still
alive, and writhed all over its body, to free itself from
the torture. The nine assassins were probably annoyed at
the light, for they at once stopped eating, and jointly
carried off the victim to a darker part of the nest.
Meanwhile many others crowded up to partake in this
feast of royal flesh.<a href='#f9' class='c016'><sup>[9]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c017'>A soldier, too, has been observed to kill and partially
eat one of its worker companions, nor is it altogether uncommon
for an individual of any class, after licking, for
some little while, the leg of another, suddenly to snap
it off. The bond of union, therefore, though sufficiently
developed to allow of an elaborate social organisation, is
not so strong between members of the same termitary as
it is in the case of ants, amongst which latter such unseemly
conduct is never known to occur. So, too, unless
a particular chemical substance, which seems to have a
maddening effect, be flung amongst them, ants of one
<a id='Page_27'></a>community never attack each other. Amongst white
ants, however, warfare will occasionally break out within
the nest, more especially if this be disturbed, in which
case the soldiers are apt to turn savagely on those nearest
to them, perhaps considering them as the cause of the
calamity. Still, upon the whole, order, and, if not friendship,
at least co-operation, is conspicuously displayed, and
the majority often interfere to put a stop to such individual
or partial combats as may from time to time
break out.</p>

<p class='c017'>There is more excuse for the soldier termites in their
cannibalistic propensities, since owing to the special development
of their jaws, which are long and slender, they
are unable to triturate wood, which is the basis of diet
of these insects. They might die, therefore, but for such
occasional lapses, were it not the common practice for all
members of the community to feed one another, though
the soldiers, for the above reason, are much more dependent
on such aid. The food thus administered has
just been swallowed by the individual who parts with it.
Such transfer is performed in two ways, the first of which
is familiar enough—that process, namely, known as regurgitation—but
the second and more staple one is too
peculiar to be dealt with in a non-scientific work. When
a termite regurgitates, an exceedingly small round pellet
of reddish-brown colour may be seen, by attentive observation,
to form about the mouth, and gradually to increase
in size till it becomes plainly apparent, and is seen to
consist of food—that is to say, wood—which has previously
been swallowed, in a moistened and softened
<a id='Page_28'></a>condition. Sometimes this pellet is used for building
purposes, but often another termite comes forward, receives,
and swallows it.</p>

<p class='c017'>Another article of diet which has a peculiar efficacy,
and is used for a certain purpose, has been already alluded
to—viz. saliva. This, we are told, “issues,” when required
to do so, “as a colourless and distinctly alkaline
liquid. It collects on the labium (the insect equivalent
of lips) as a small drop, which may be employed either as
a cement in building or as food for others. These may
either possess themselves of the drop and then retreat a
little way in order to swallow it gradually, or they may
receive it from the one which secretes it and clearly
provides it for them as an article of diet. The assimilation
of a drop requires a certain number of acts of
deglutition, which may be counted, and are usually four
or five.”<a href='#f9' class='c016'><sup>[9]</sup></a> Very young larvæ (the whole community, it
must be remembered, are either in this or the pupal state)
are fed after this fashion, until sufficiently advanced to be
able to swallow wood-meal. Under this course of diet
the abdomen becomes remarkably transparent, and this,
in older individuals, is an indication that they are being
bred up by the workers to become royal substitutes. The
development, therefore, of termites from the larval to the
perfect, or, at least, the sexually perfect form, seems to be
wholly dependent on their being fed with this substance.</p>

<p class='c017'>As is well known, the body of the queen termite, in the
African and other tropical species, swells, when about to
lay, to an enormous size, but this is not nearly so noticeably
the case with her European representatives. Neither
<a id='Page_29'></a>is a cell, in this case, constructed for her accommodation,
but the royal pair, whether they are true king and queen,
or only substitutes, “remain, in close proximity, in the
heart of the nest, where the inmates are always most
crowded.” They are not imprisoned, therefore; but can
go from one place to another, should they, as sometimes
happens, wish to change their situation. In this they
would seem to be happier than their more specially
accommodated royal cousins, but no doubt, with the
latter, or at any rate with the queen, the instinct of
locomotion ceases with the capacity to indulge in it.
The purpose of the specially made cell is probably rather
to guard than to restrain the queen.</p>

<p class='c017'>In regard to the swarming of white ants—another habit
in which we are reminded both of ants and bees—with
the subsequent founding of a new colony, Professor Grassi
has the following remarks to make. They apply more
especially to the larger of the two European species, viz.
Calotermes. “Before swarming,” he tells us, “they collect
near one of the exit-holes of the termitary, and when
the proper time comes, issue from it in ones or twos,
so that the twenty or thirty members who are ready to
take flight emerge in perhaps a quarter of an hour.
Once outside, they run upwards, if the locality admits
of it, for a few metres, and then only do they take wing.
In a room they fly towards the light, and if a wind is
blowing they follow its direction. Some, becoming tired,
settle soon upon trunks of trees, and all may do this
eventually. Here they group themselves into pairs, the
males and females of which must frequently be derived
<a id='Page_30'></a>from separate nests, since the sexes swarm separately;
this acts as a safeguard by which Calotermes habitually
avoids in and in breeding. Matrimonial alliances having
been thus formed, the work of excavation commences,
each pair seeking for some decayed spot in which to bury
themselves and become, in time, the parents of a fresh
community. The wings, by this time, have been got rid
of. They may be shed by coming into contact with
an obstacle, or by getting damp and adhering to some
spot, while the insect continues to move. But, if not
favoured by chance, the Calotermite purposely rids itself
of these now useless encumbrances. Thus four perfect
insects were captured after flying about the room, and
put under a piece of rotten wood. Hardly had they
settled when they stripped off their wings by resting the
tips against some projecting corner of the wood, and then
moving backwards a little, so that the wings bent near
the base, broke, and dropped off. When rid of them they
began to gnaw the wood, at first along and then across
the grain. When they encountered each other by chance
they first threatened to bite one another, and then ran off
in opposite directions. This was because they were of the
same sex. Had they been of opposite ones, an attachment,
under such circumstances, would no doubt have been formed
between them.”<a href='#f9' class='c016'><sup>[9]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c017'>This is all the space which I can afford to these
interesting insects. There are many other points in
connection with them which I might have touched upon,
but I thought it better to say less about what may
be read by anyone in a score or so of works, and select as
<a id='Page_31'></a>my text-book a series of the closest and most interesting
observations, which lie buried in the pages of a scientific
journal not at all likely to meet the public eye. Where
possible, I shall be guided by the same or a similar principle
throughout this small work.</p>

<p class='c014'>Ants and white ants—Guest insects—Ants’-nest beetles—Doubtful
relations—A strange forbearance—Yellow ants and white wood-lice—Beetles
fed by ants.</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_0_4 c015'>FROM what has been said about the Termites in the
last chapter, it is clear that they very much resemble
ants in their habits, so that it is no wonder
that they have long passed for ants in popular estimation.
Such a similarity is quite enough to justify one part of
the name, as names go; and as for the word white, which
entomologists are always complaining about, that is quite
near enough too, for though their bodies are not white,
but yellow, yet the greater part of them—the soft fat
abdomen, which particularly catches the eye—is of such a
light yellow that it suggests white in contrast to the
darker colouring of most ants. Scientific men—unless
their particular science is philology—are dreadful pedants
in regard to names, and always want to substitute their
own manufactured ones, which have no real life in them,
for what has sprung up naturally on the lips of the
people. Thus, instead of hedge-sparrow—a name that
explains itself to anyone who has seen the bird and knows
something of its ways—ornithologists would have us say
“hedge-accentor”—a preposterous concoction—and stormy
petrel should, according to them, be “storm-petrel,”
<a id='Page_33'></a>because the bird itself cannot be stormy, whatever the
sea may be. No imagination behind the common use of
language, then. No poetic transference of attributes.
All is to be as prosy as professors can make it, and “we
must speak by the card, or equivocation will undo us.”
But names, which are a part of language, come into being
as language itself does—spontaneously, that is to say, and
by a natural growth. They are right because they exist;
and the very errors contained in them—telling, as they
do, of popular beliefs and superstitions—are of greater
and wider interest than the rectitudes of a few pedants.
Could they play with substance as they can with breath,
these wise simpletons would first draw up a theory of
anatomy, and then annul all bodies that did not conform
to it. Such and such a word or name is wrong, in their
eyes, though it exists quite as naturally as any nerve or
muscle, and is quite as tough though only made of air.
This last they will find if they live long enough, and
“hedge-sparrow” and “stormy petrel” will survive all
their lifeless substitutions, though embalmed in many
dull paragraphs of many dull books.</p>

<p class='c017'>But let us come back from words to things. Much
as the white ants resemble real ones in many of
their habits, the more remarkable ones that distinguish
the latter are not practised by them. They make no
slaves and keep no domestic animals—at least I have
never heard of their doing so, though in natural history
one must always be prepared for new discoveries. Many
insects do, in fact, live with them in the termitary, just as
others live in the formicaries of ants, and it is quite
<a id='Page_34'></a>possible that, when these have been better studied, some of
them will be found to have special relations—involving
mutual intelligent action—with their landlords.</p>

<p class='c017'>At present, however, we seem to have little or no information
on this head. With ants it is different, and
perhaps one of the most interesting chapters in their
history is that which has to do with these <i><span lang="la">myrmecophilous</span></i>,
or guest insects, as they are called.<a id='r10'></a><a href='#f10' class='c016'><sup>[10]</sup></a> Take, for
instance, the ants’-nest beetles, and especially one family—the
<i><span lang="la">Paussidæ</span></i>—which numbers some 200 species, every
one of which passes the whole of its life, when not flying
by night, within the nest of some species of ant. These
beetles are small, as might be expected, the largest being
not more than half an inch in length, but present an
extraordinary appearance owing to the antennæ ending in
two broad palmated surfaces, like the horns of a moose
deer, which project outwards, one on each side, at right
angles with two short stalks, forming the only serviceable
joints of these strangely modified feelers. All the other
ones (in some species, at any rate) have been fused
and welded together to form these flattened club-like
structures, the use of which is not at first-sight apparent,
and may not be fully understood. If, however,
a <i><span lang="la">paussus</span></i> is laid on its back upon a flat surface, a
predicament which would be as embarrassing to many
beetles as it is to a turtle, one of their special functions
is at once seen. Turning back the two clubs
till they rest on the ground, and making the joint rigid,
the insect uses the one most conveniently placed as a
<a id='Page_35'></a>lever, and soon gets on to its legs again. Could we
imagine that such an expedient would often need to
be resorted to, the curious modification of the antennæ
is at once explained; but it probably rarely happens that
any small beetle finds itself on its back in a place where
there are no irregularities to aid it in righting itself.
Possibly, however, the smooth galleries or chambers of
some of the larger ants might expose these <i><span lang="la">Myrmicophilæ</span></i>
to such a catastrophe, though, for my part, I suppose
that the antennæ are used in some other special way
which is of far more importance to their owners.</p>

<p class='c017'>The relations existing between the ants and these
curious beetles has not yet been fully made out. It is
true that the various species of <i><span lang="la">Paussidæ</span></i> have upon some
part of their bodies a smooth downy substance—a <i>pubescence</i>,
to use the word dear to entomologists—which in
other ants’-nest beetles is known to exude a sweet honey-like
dew which the ants, not unnaturally, are very fond of,
and for which they assiduously lick them. As they have
also been seen to lick their <i><span lang="la">Paussi</span></i>, we seem, here, to
have at least the root of the matter, nor does the fact
that, at other times, when perhaps these have ceased to
supply the attraction, they pay little attention to them,
seem of much importance, since we are all neglected when
we have given what we have to give. But there are
other circumstances not of so straightforward a nature.
It has been lately discovered by a French observer—M.
Péringuey—that these <i><span lang="la">Paussidæ</span></i>, welcome guests as
they generally are, will yet, sometimes, eat the larvæ of
the ants with whom they live, when any small worker is
<a id='Page_36'></a>engaged in carrying them from one place to another.
The ants resent this, and occasionally a large one, who
feels himself equal to the undertaking, will attack and
even kill a <i><span lang="la">Paussus</span></i> that he sees behaving in such a
manner. Yet, with all this, so valued are these beetles by
the ants that they often drag them back into their nests,
when they have approached, or emerge from, the entrance.
On such occasions, and also when the ants attack and
even dismember them, the <i><span lang="la">Paussidæ</span></i> make no sort of
resistance. Yet they are extremely well able to do so,
being armed with a weapon of tremendous efficiency, by
which in a moment they could kill or stun a whole crowd
of ants round about them. For they are bombardier
beetles, having the power at any moment of discharging
a fluid of a highly acrid nature, and so volatile that, on
coming in contact with the air, it explodes with a puff of
blue smoke, exhaling at the same time a very pungent
and unpleasant odour. When they are tickled with a
straw, even, this bombardment at once takes place, and
ants all round are seen to stagger or drop to the earth.
Small workers are killed, large ones retreat in confusion;
yet the owner of this deadly battery, which can only
have been developed for the express purpose of overwhelming
an enemy, will not, even to save life or limb, discharge
it against an ant—not one, at least, to whom it stands in
these somewhat doubtful relations.</p>

<p class='c017'>How have these relations—whatever in their entirety
they may be—come about? My own idea is that these
beetles, like some other creatures—amongst them the
little white wood-louse that lives with our own <i>Formica
<a id='Page_37'></a>flava</i>—found ants’ nests very comfortable places of
retirement, since, by reason of their peculiar weapon of
defence, they could defy any attempt to interfere with
them, on the part of the ants. The ants, on their side,
would soon have given up molesting them, so that, never
requiring to defend themselves against the creatures by
whom they were surrounded, the intruders got to associate
them with quite other ideas, and, having first lost the
habit, at length lost the power of turning their artillery
in this direction. Meanwhile <i><span lang="la">Paussus</span></i>, owing to its sweet
secretion, which, after relations had once become amicable,
the ants would soon have discovered, had got to be a
very welcome guest, so much so that, even when it took
to eating their larvæ, they retained their love for it, as
a species, though resenting such conduct upon the individual.
And now the once redoubtable invader could
be punished with impunity, for the habit of never discharging
against an ant had become a fixed, inherited instinct,
not to be got rid of even though life were at stake.
Thus, as it appears to me, it may have come about that,
though armed with dynamite, and carrying bombs, no
living <i><span lang="la">Paussus</span></i> has ever defended itself against an ant, and
no living ant, perhaps, ever seen a <i><span lang="la">Paussus</span></i> discharge its
artillery. Of course these are only conjectures, and the
last, especially, may be opposed to fact, since it has been
suggested that one way in which <i><span lang="la">Paussus</span></i> may make itself
useful within the nest of its hosts, may be by bombarding
certain obnoxious parasites, or other would-be invaders.
This does not, however, appear to me to be likely, for
how could these explosion take place, under such circumstances,
<a id='Page_38'></a>without doing damage to the ants themselves?
In one’s own house one would hardly wish a bomb to be
thrown, even against one’s greatest enemy—at any rate
not in the drawing-room. That the ants should, by this
means, be able, or, if able, willing to rid themselves of the
mites which infest them, as has been conjectured, seems
especially unlikely—indeed, hardly possible. On the
whole, it seems to me that the relations at present existing
between the two insects could only have grown up
through <i><span lang="la">Paussus</span></i> having ceased to discharge, not only at an
ant, but even—owing, probably, to there never being any
occasion for it—in an ants’ nest. The experimental tickling
with a straw was, of course, an artificial stimulus.
In spite of its sweet secretion, I cannot see how a beetle
with such a power at its command as <i><span lang="la">Paussus</span></i> has, can
have been originally selected by the ants for domestication,
but, on the other hand, an armed invader might
easily, by coincidence, possess some property which would
make it, in time, of use and value to the population on
which it forced itself.</p>

<p class='c017'>An example of an invader having no such merit, but
harmless, and that has become tolerated through necessity,
is, in my opinion, the little white wood-louse before mentioned.
It apparently has now lost the power of rolling
itself into a ball, but when it first began to penetrate into
the galleries of <i><span lang="la">Formica flava</span></i>—our little yellow ant—it
may very well have had it, and this would have rendered
it impervious to attack, whilst its weight and round scaly
surface would have made the task of removing it almost
an impossible one. Thus, perforce, it stayed where it
<a id='Page_39'></a>wished to stay, penetrating, perhaps, deeper and deeper
into the labyrinth of galleries, as successive generations
of cave animals have retreated farther and farther from
the light of day, until at length, finding the wherewithal
to live, it became wholly subterranean in its habits, lost the
power of doing what it never required to do—namely, of
rolling itself into a ball—and, through the absence of all
sunlight, lost, too, its colouring matter, and became of its
present dead, bleached white. Whether its eyesight, if
it ever had any, is also gone, I do not know; but it can
hardly, under present conditions, have any use for it,
whereas its antennæ are constantly moving, and seem to
be of extreme delicacy. I could never observe—for I have
kept nests of <i><span lang="la">Formica flava</span></i>—the smallest sign of any
kind of relations between these wood-lice and their hosts;
and if any scavenger work is done by the former, from
which the latter derive benefit, I believe that this is
merely incidental, and that the ants know nothing about
it. But they have got accustomed to the wood-lice
being there, and put up with them because they cannot
help it.</p>

<p class='c017'>It must be remembered, in regard to <i><span lang="la">Paussidæ</span></i>, that
the family is represented by some two hundred species,
all of which pass the greater part of their lives with ants.
In regard to this Mr. Kirby remarks: “The observations
made upon the family are so contradictory that the
discrepancies can only be accounted for by supposing
that different species have very different habits. Possibly
some species may perform various useful services to the
ants, while others are hostile; or they may be so useful
<a id='Page_40'></a>that the ants are willing to pay toll of a certain number
of their offspring, in return.”<a id='r11'></a><a href='#f11' class='c016'><sup>[11]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c017'>This last, however, does not seem very well to accord
with recorded observations as to ants attacking any
individual <i><span lang="la">Paussus</span></i> whom they may chance to see devouring
their larvæ, nor with the latter refusing to bombard,
under these circumstances, even when in danger of their
lives. It is impossible to imagine a hostile <i><span lang="la">Paussus</span></i> not
bombarding, in such a case, unless, indeed, we suppose it
to have first lost its hostility, and then again to have
become hostile, without, however, regaining the power
of using its natural weapon. But this is a state of affairs
hardly to be conceived.</p>

<p class='c017'>We probably do not know the whole round of occupations
which make up the life by day, of the <i><span lang="la">Paussidæ</span></i>; of
their life by night, we know nothing at all. The nefarious
raids upon the larvæ or eggs (for both are appreciated)
of the ants can hardly be of frequent occurrence, or the
partnership, one would think, must come to an end.
Other ant-guests, however, including sometimes smaller
members of their own family, are likewise preyed upon
by these curious beetles, but very frequently, when
observed, they seem to be asleep, nor do they appear
then to be taken much notice of by the ants. Where
or under what conditions their eggs are hatched, or what
is the larval and pupal history of each species, we do
not know, but only the perfect insect has as yet been
found in any ants’ nest.</p>

<p class='c017'>Other beetles that live with ants are either indifferent
or hostile to them, but others, again, are kept and tended
<a id='Page_41'></a>in the same manner as are the aphides, and for a similar
purpose. All or most of these secrete some sweet substance,
which their hosts lick up, and, in return, offer them
an asylum from all enemies, and are ready to give them
their personal protection, should this be necessary. They
go even further than this, and actually feed them as they
do their own larvæ, with honey, or something of a similar
nature, which they regurgitate from their crops. One
little beetle—<i><span lang="la">Atemeles</span></i> by name—is extremely fond of such
a meal, and solicits it from the ants by stopping in front
of them and assuming a certain attitude, accompanied
with insinuating motions of the antennæ. Whether
<i><span lang="la">Atemeles</span></i> is able to feed itself, or must live wholly upon
these ministrations, I am not quite sure; but another
beetle—poor <i><span lang="la">Clavigertestaceus</span></i>—is, according to Janet, so
entirely dependent upon the ants for subsistence that, if
separated from them, he has nothing to do but to die.</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_0_4 c015'>LEAVING the beetles—though as there are probably
some thousands that live habitually in ants’
nests, we have said very little about them—we may
glance at an extraordinary little creature, in appearance
something like a wood-louse with a fish’s tail, that resides
with certain ants on the footing of a freebooter, constantly
stealing from them, and eluding their resentment
by extreme activity, living, as it were, in a state of
perpetual motion. The legs of these persistent yet
withal timid brigands are many and long, which, together
with their shape and general lightness of build, enables
them to run with great speed, so that they easily outdistance
the ants, and, escaping to some less frequented
part of the nest, with which they are always well
acquainted, remain there quiet for a time. Should a
single ant approach them, however, they immediately run
away, or, if forced by circumstances to be near one or
more—which, in an ants’ nest, must be often difficult to
avoid—make a point, apparently, of never keeping still,
as though to confuse them, or, perhaps, to be the better
able to dash off at any instant.</p>

<p><span class='small'>AN INSECT FREEBOOTER, AND AN INSECT BEGGAR.</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c002'>The extraordinary looking insect shown towards the top is the lepismid, or fleet-foot, who
lives by stealing food from ants when they are in the act of passing it from one to the
other. The atemeles beetle shown below is begging food, which will not be refused, from
the ant in front of him.</p>

<p class='c015'><a id='Page_43'></a>The way in which these fleet-foots secure their food is
highly remarkable, each little theft—which has about it
more of the parasite than the brigand—occasioning a
group of three. The ants upon which they live are of
the species known as <i><span lang="la">Lasius umbratus</span></i>, and, like many
other kinds, often feed one another, the hungry asking
of the full, by whom he is rarely, if ever, denied. In
the process of regurgitation—with which we are now
familiar—the two stand fronting each other, with mandibles
interlocked, and a drop of honey passes from
mouth to mouth. For an instant it trembles between
the two, resting on both, and that instant is the opportunity
of the <i><span lang="la">Lepismid</span></i>. Darting forward, he interposes
his own, and having absorbed some portion of the drop
<i><span lang="la">in transitu</span></i>, speeds swiftly away to make a third elsewhere.
Such a life, however great may be the thief’s agility, is
full of danger, and, from time to time, an individual is
captured and killed. In nests under observation such
executions may be witnessed, and <i><span lang="la">Lepismid</span></i> corpses—or,
as various professors prefer calling them, <i>cadavers</i>—are
sometimes noted. Under artificial conditions, however,
opportunities of escape are much more limited, unless,
indeed, some special provision is made. Thus, when
Professor Wheeler first introduced a colony of <i>Lasius
umbratus</i> into one of his <i><span lang="la">formicariums</span></i>, he found, after a
couple of <i><span lang="la">dies</span></i>,<a id='r12'></a><a href='#f12' class='c016'><sup>[12]</sup></a> five <i>Lepismid cadavers</i>. But having, by
the addition to the said <i><span lang="la">formicarium</span></i> of a <i><span lang="la">refugium</span></i>,
or asylum, made it more as <i><span lang="la">in natura</span></i>, this mortality
ceased, and the remaining <i><span lang="la">Lepismids</span></i> continued henceforth
<i><span lang="la">existentes</span></i>.</p>

<p class='c017'><a id='Page_44'></a>A similar mode of feeding, but under circumstances of
much greater security, is indulged in by <i><span lang="la">Antennophorus</span></i>,
another ant-guest, whose relations with its host are of a
still closer description. <i><span lang="la">Antennophorus</span></i> is a mite which,
according to M. Janet, fixes itself on to the head, or the
sides of the abdomen, of the ant which it affects, and
clings there as long as it sees fit. This it is enabled to
do owing to a special adaptation of the feet, which end
in little horny cups (<i><span lang="la">cornicula</span></i> is the word here) furnished
with some substance of so adhesive a quality that it
might well be called “stickphast,” if no Latin word were
at hand. Not all the feet, however, are of this description,
for the anterior ones are transformed into a pair of
long waving antennæ, which contain olfactory organs of
the greatest sensibility. With these their owner makes
up for the want of eyes, and, smelling and feeling its
way, walks, when it wishes to, along the bodies of its
hosts, passing from one to another. Sometimes, either
by accident or otherwise, it becomes detached, and is then
helpless as far as locomotion is concerned, but by no
means so in other respects. Its object, now, is to reaffix
itself: nor is it long before it succeeds in doing so.
As it “lies upon the soil in one of the galleries of the
nest it raises and stretches forward its first pair of
ambulatory feet, and, at the same time, explores the
space around it with its long antenniform ones. These
appendages are much more agitated when an ant passes
<a id='Page_45'></a>close by. Should it pass near enough, the <i><span lang="la">Acarid</span></i> (which
has a finer sound than ‘mite’) glues itself on to its body
by means of the cup of sticky material at the end of one
of its ambulatory feet, which it holds up ready for this
operation, and it can, in this way, soon climb up and fix
itself in a good position on its host. The latter is surprised,
and seeks to rid itself of its strange companion,
but failing in this, it becomes resigned very quickly (as
we do to increased taxation) as soon as the <i><span lang="la">Acarid</span></i> has
taken up one of its normal positions.”<a id='r13'></a><a href='#f13' class='c016'><sup>[13]</sup></a> It will carry two
indeed, or even three, without complaining. An ant with
one of these burdens fixed, like the income-tax, to the
under side of its head, and two others, which may stand
for a rise in tea and sugar, is a very common sight.</p>

<p class='c017'>The feeding of <i><span lang="la">Antennophorus</span></i> has been closely observed
by M. Janet in his artificial nests, and is thus described
by him: “The ants had acquired a habit of placing
themselves, crowded one against another, in one corner of
the nest, and thither came such as had their crops well
filled, after a meal of honey, and disgorged it before
the mouths of their comrades who had none. While the
fasting ant was eating the honey thus disgorged, <i><span lang="la">Antennophorus</span></i>,
riding on its head, took its share. To do this, it
pushed itself forward, and thrust its rostrum into the
droplet, and generally, whilst holding itself in position
by means of the two hinder pairs of legs, it attached itself
by means of the forward pair (which in this case, however,
would represent antennæ) to the head of the disgorging
ant.”<a href='#f13' class='c016'><sup>[13]</sup></a> Perhaps there is some little mistake here—possibly
I have not copied the passage correctly. There has been
<a id='Page_46'></a>no hint before as to the modified antenniform legs of the
parasite performing any other office than that of feeling
and smelling, whilst the word “attach” or “affix” is that
always used to describe the working of the sticky, cup-footed
ones. In the position described the antennæ might
very well act as supports, but hardly, one would think, in
such a way as that their owner could be described as
attaching himself through their means. Possibly it is
the first pair of true legs that act in this way, but the
matter is of no great consequence—not more than a war,
say, or the fall of a ministry, in the general run of things.
Suffice it that we have our picture, the little parasite
stretched, like a bridge, between the heads of the feeding
and disgorging ants, and taking its share with the
latter.</p>

<p class='c017'><i>Lasius something</i> is the name of the ant which <i><span lang="la">Antennophorus</span></i>
utilises in this way, and it is, I think, a European
species. Another one—<i><span lang="la">Pachycondyla harpax</span></i>—the large,
black ant of America—wears its parasite round its neck,
like an Elizabethan ruff. In this case both host and
guest are in the larval state, and the involuntary partnership
between them—involuntary probably on the part of
either—is not dissolved until both have attained full
maturity. The position of affairs is this: the ant larva
apparently lies on its back upon earth a little hollowed,
to receive it, by the workers of the nest. The parasitic
larva—that of an unknown species of fly—has a long,
slender neck, as we may call the anterior part of the
body, and whilst this is wound about the corresponding
portion of its host, the body, which broadens out after
<a id='Page_47'></a>the manner of an oil-flask, is affixed by a disc at its end
to some part of the back of the latter. When the ants
feed the larvæ, they place the food—which consists either
of grain that has been stored, or of insects captured
and torn up by them—on the broad surface of the
abdomen, which forms a sort of trough for its reception.
Immediately upon feeling the welcome load, the hungry
larva stretches down its head to the banquet, but that
of the parasite moves with it, and its small, sharp jaws
take eager toll of each dish. Thus the two feed together,
cheek by jowl, and should what has been provided prove
insufficient for this double onslaught, the unbidden guest
will stretch its snake-like neck, and move it ceaselessly
until the ever-ready jaws come into contact with a second
feast, upon the table next it. Should none, however, be
within reach, the guest will give vent to its irritated
feelings by biting the bodies of such unbounteous Timons,
or even that of its own host. They wriggle with pain,
and this may possibly induce the ants to bring them fresh
supplies, under the impression that they are hungry, as
indeed they may be, with meals shared in this way. If so,
we can hardly suppose a parasitic larva to act with such a
motive, but as the best biters would in this case get the
most food, natural selection may possibly have helped to
develop the habit, which would have a compensating
advantage for the wrigglers too. As the French say,
“<i><span lang="fr">Il y a compensation en tout.</span></i>”</p>

<p class='c017'>The parasite, whilst stretching out as far as it can from
the body of its host, in quest of food, remains, all the
while, attached to the latter by the disc in which its body
<a id='Page_48'></a>ends. It can, however, leave one ant larva for another,
though Professor Wheeler, to whom we owe this interesting
discovery, believes that it does this “with great
reluctance, and only under urgent circumstances, such as
extreme hunger, the death of the larva to which it is
attached, and perhaps, when fully mature, and about to
pupate.”<a id='r14'></a><a href='#f14' class='c016'><sup>[14]</sup></a> So long, indeed, as its original host, on whose
body, when quite young, it was probably hatched from
the egg, continues well and is well fed, it has no reason
to seek farther, since all its wants are provided for. It is
not only fed by the worker ants, but shares in any other
of the benefits which these may bestow upon the rising
generation of the nest. Thus, if they move larvæ, as is
customary, to give them change of temperature, and
produce the requisite hygienic conditions, the parasite is
moved along with them, and it is cleaned also—a still
more important advantage possibly—at the same time as
they are. At such times the ants never seem to notice
the uncouth incubus upon the bodies of their infant
sisters, though one would suppose the difficulty would be
not to do so. They are, it is true, blind, or nearly so, but
it seems strange that their sense of touch, which is no
doubt delicate, should not be able to inform them, since
the parasite, though small enough, absolutely, is of great
size regarded as an excrescence on its host’s body. This
probably is the way in which the matter presents itself to
the ants, if they think about it at all, for since the two
lives are passed constantly together, and are subjected to
the same conditions, it is likely that they share one smell
between them.</p>

<p class='c017'><a id='Page_49'></a>But this curious parasitic relation between ant and fly is
not confined to the larval stage of each. Continued
observation led to a further discovery which I give in
Professor Wheeler’s own words: “As the days passed, the
mature ant-larvæ spun their brown cocoons one by one,
and one by one the mature commensals (the larval parasites,
that is to say) disappeared. No traces of them
could be discovered. The only remaining resource was to
open the cocoons. Five were opened, and in two of
recent formation commensals were found! Having shared
the table of their host, they had come to share its bed as
well. The dipteron (the parasite, as I have said, is a fly)
had pupated after the manner of its kind, forming a
puparium, that is, instead of spinning a cocoon like the ant
larva: the dead larval skin, somewhat shrivelled and contracted,
was used as an envelope, and within this the pupa
proper was found. In all cases the puparium was located
in the caudal pole (at the bottom) of the ant cocoon, and
was immovably stuck to the wall of the cocoon, its
anterior end directed towards the cephalic pole”<a href='#f14' class='c016'><sup>[14]</sup></a> (the top).
But what, asks Professor Wheeler, does the commensal
larva do “while the ant-larva is weaving its cocoon?
Does it move about to avoid the swaying jaws of the
spinning larva? or does it take up its position, from the
first, at the posterior end of the larval ant, and there
remain motionless while the posterior pole of the cocoon
is being completed? It is very difficult to answer these
questions.”<a href='#f14' class='c016'><sup>[14]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c017'>One might think that young ants thus deprived, day by
day, of a portion of every meal, would be stunted in their
<a id='Page_50'></a>growth, and not make such large and healthy workers as
those who had never been encumbered with a parasite.
This, however, does not seem to be the case, and no
difference can be detected between the one and the other.
Perhaps, therefore, ants habitually eat, if not more than is
good for them, at least more than they require. This is
the case almost universally amongst civilised men, at least
in Northern Europe, and with savages to a still greater
extent whenever the wherewithal is at hand. In the
above case we have, as Professor Wheeler remarks, a very
perfect example of what is termed commensalism, in the
original meaning of the word—that is to say, of two or
more individuals dining together at the same table. As
applied to natural history, the individuals in question must
be of different species, but it is not often that the definition
otherwise is so rigorously adhered to.</p>

<p class='c017'>This curious parasite inhabits the nests, or, more
strictly speaking, the bodies, of an ant, native to Texas,
that has long been famous as a storer of grain, but whose
supposed still further achievements in an agricultural
direction would now seem open to doubt. In the nest of
another American ant, which most certainly does grow
mushrooms, the same observer found another “<i><span lang="la">myrmecophile</span></i>,”
or ants’ nest insect, viz. a minute species of cockroach
that lives its life amongst the caves and galleries of the
great vegetable mass which forms, and is designed to form,
the mushroom bed, upon the product of which it feeds.
Here again the ants have become thoroughly reconciled
to the presence amongst them of a guest from which, as
far as can be seen, they derive no benefit, whilst having
<a id='Page_51'></a>to submit to a loss, through its agency, of some part
of the fruits of their labours. These little cockroaches
are fairly numerous, and have become so adapted to living
in darkness that their eyes have almost disappeared.
Another loss, or partial loss, is of a more curious nature,
and, one might think, would be a great privation to them.
Their antennæ, namely, are always incomplete, but this
does not seem to have come about by a gradual process of
atrophy, but rather to have been caused by mutilation
during their owners’ lifetime. But how has this happened,
and what has been the mutilating agency? Professor
Wheeler’s explanation, which he believes to be the only
one, is that their antennæ have been unconsciously sheared
off by the ants, whilst engaged either in clipping their
mushrooms or in cutting up the pieces of leaves which
they are continually bringing into the nest, to add to the
bed on which they grow. “It is easy,” he says, “to understand
how an insect like a cockroach, living in the midst
of thousands of ants which are continually opening and
closing their scissor-like mandibles, should be certain,
sooner or later, to have its long antennæ cropped. One
wonders how the tarsi (the legs, that is to say) of the
cockroach escape the same treatment.”<a id='r15'></a><a href='#f15' class='c016'><sup>[15]</sup></a> This wonder,
however, if there is really any reason for it, suggests a
doubt as to the sufficiency of the explanation here offered.
The antennæ, one would think, might be held high, in
which case, if sheared at all, it could only be at the base,
but if here (as would not, however, seem to be the case)
why should not the legs be sheared too? Again, it seems
possible that the insects themselves may be in the habit of
<a id='Page_52'></a>gnawing one another’s antennæ. As the cockroaches live
and flourish it would seem that this mutilation of their
antennæ, if that, indeed, be the explanation, can do them
no great injury. Yet these organs are supposed to be of
great importance to insects, and, judging by their length
and delicacy, one would think that they were especially so
to the members of the cockroach family. In this case they
would probably be extremely careful of them, and the fact
that these ants’-nest cockroaches do not seem to be so,
may show that subterranean conditions, contrary to what
one might have expected, have affected their efficacy.</p>

<p><span class='small'>A RIDE ON BEETLE-BACK, AND A LIVING SWEET-SHOP.</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c002'>Enjoyment seems to be the only motive the fly has for riding on the back of the African beetle
shown in the upper part of this illustration. Beneath is shown the well named honey-pot
ant with its distended body full of honey, which it gives away to any hungry working ant.</p>

<p class='c015'><a id='Page_53'></a>A diet of mushrooms, or fungus, is not the only thing
for which these little blind, light-shunning cockroaches
are indebted to their landlords, the ants, for often one of
them may be seen to mount upon one of the latter, and
take a ride on its back. They seem especially fond of
the soldiers, as horses, and will sit perched on their enormous
heads, as they walk up and down in a stately sort of
way, sometimes for quite a long time. Enjoyment seems
here to be the only motive, and perhaps it is a natural
one, since there is a fly in Africa which seems to have
quite a passion for riding on the back of a beetle.
“Across the mouth of the Seyhouse,” says the Rev. Mr.
Eaton, “on sandy pasture-land bordering the seashore,
big <i>coprophagous</i> beetles—it sounds abusive, but no harm
is meant—are common, sheltering in large holes in the
soil, when at rest, and running about on business. A
small species of <i><span lang="la">Borborinæ</span></i> (that is the fly) may often be
seen riding on their backs, chiefly on the pronotum and
about the bases of the elytra, sometimes half a dozen
females on one beetle. The beetles occasionally throw
themselves on their backs, and try to get rid of them by
rolling; but the flies elude all their efforts to dislodge
them, dodging out of harm’s way into the jointures of the
thorax, and darting from back to breast, and back again,
in a way that drives the beetle nearly mad. In vain she
scrapes over them with her legs, in vain does she roll over,
or delve down amongst the roots of the herbage: the flies
are as active as monkeys (not perhaps a very striking
simile here), and there is no shaking them off. It is
difficult (such is their strange predilection) to get them
off into the killing-bottle. Nothing (not even the
killing-bottle) persuades them to fly, and they would very
much rather stick to the beetle than——” what? Not go
to heaven, but “be driven off it down the tube.”<a id='r16'></a><a href='#f16' class='c016'><sup>[16]</sup></a> The
tube must be the neck of that same bottle. This, surely,
is a case of infatuation if ever there was one. Eccentric
fly! And what must be the charms of a beetle that can
prevail over those of cyanide of potassium! But the
beetle, it must be remembered, is a <i>coprophagous</i> one.
There may be a world of explanation in a word like
that.</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_0_4 c015'>ALTHOUGH from the way in which the story is told,
one might imagine that the fly here was merely
enjoying a ride upon beetle-back, yet, from the
efforts made by the latter to shake off its persecutors,
and, still more, because these were of the female sex, the
probability is that we have here to do with a case of
parasitism. The fly, we may almost feel certain, was
endeavouring to lay its eggs, and the reason why she took
so long about it was that she required a certain spot
upon the beetle in order to do so, and that the beetle’s
efforts, though appearing futile, were more or less
successful in guarding this spot. At any rate, if this
was not the case here, it is so in many other instances,
various flies being parasitic on various other insects. Not
all of these are fatal to the object of their choice, which,
if it affords them board as well as lodgings, may only do
so to the extent of its blood. Such are the curious family
of <i><span lang="la">Hippoboscidæ</span></i>, or Bird Ticks, who begin life with
wings, but are so little appreciative of the powers which
these confer that, having found the creature upon whom
they elect to live, they bite them off, or otherwise wilfully
<a id='Page_55'></a>rid themselves of them, after the manner of ants and
termites, thus offering yet another example in the insect

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c015'>For what can be imagined more glorious to possess,
speaking of physical attributes, than the power of flight?</p>

<p class='c017'>The course of life of these flies—if all be truth that is
spoken of them—is, indeed, very extraordinary, for during
the first or winged stage of their adult life they live on
birds, but migrate from them to some quadruped—as, say,
a deer—as soon as they find themselves within easy reach
of it, and then, as having reached their final place of
abode, do away with their wings. Thus, being too lazy
or lethargic to fly themselves, they choose rather to stand
indebted to another being for a power which they no
doubt once possessed in perfection, and which they are
still quite capable of exercising. What the larval stage
of these flies is, whether they lay their eggs upon their
first or last habitation—or on both, and if not, where or
in what manner the larva passes its life, I do not know, and
as my authority, who should be up to date, holds his peace
upon the matter, I conclude that it is not yet made out.
Possibly the grub is a vegetable feeder, or possibly, again,
it is as fatal to some other insect as is that of a little fly
with a big name—<i><span lang="la">Apocephalus pergandei</span></i> to wit—to ants.
The victim here chosen—if there be not others also—is
a black tree-climbing ant, common in Pennsylvania. As it
runs over the ground or up and down the trunks of trees,
<a id='Page_56'></a>the fly darts after it on tiny wings, intent on laying her
egg upon its neck. The ant tries to elude her endeavours,
but <i><span lang="la">Apocephalus</span></i>—or Sit-o’-my-head—has a mission to
fulfil, and will take no denial. The egg is laid, it cannot
be detached, and, when hatched, the issuing grub bores,
with enthusiasm, into the head of the ant. Coming to
the brain he has nothing to do but to eat it, and he does
so until the whole cavity of the skull has become an
empty chamber, except for his own presence there. The
movements of the ant during this process—of its feelings
we have no record—have become more and more erratic,
and it feels itself less and less capable of performing its
duties as a member of an active and industrious community.
At length it falls down, and not long afterwards
its head falls off, giving to the maggot inside it its first
opportunity of looking out into the world through the
window of the neck-hole. Hitherto its life, however easy
and pleasant, has been of a sedentary nature, but now it
can enjoy the pleasures of a walk, and moves about something
after the manner of a snail, dragging its cephalic
shell behind it. But this active state is not of long
duration. The time of change is at hand, and snug within
the ant’s head and its own last larval skin, which, as is the
way with fly caterpillars, serves it in lieu of a cocoon,
the fortunate little creature turns into a chrysalis, and
dreams away its time till, on some sunny day, it issues from
its cradle a happy, active fly, feeling strangely attracted
by ants.</p>

<p class='c017'>Another little fly belonging to this same family group—the
hump-backed flies or <i><span lang="la">Pharidæ</span></i>—has it fate linked
<a id='Page_57'></a>with that of bees, in whose hive it is hatched and on
whose eggs and larvæ it feeds; nor does the grown bee
itself, though armed with its sting, escape from the more
rapacious members of the order. These are known by the
name of Robber Flies, though as the robbery involves the
death of the victim, and consists of the juices of its
body, murder would seem to be the better word. These
flies, though of somewhat slender build, which the better
fits them for their swift and darting flight, are excessively
strong, as might be expected from their long muscular-looking
legs and rough hairy bodies. All sorts of insects
are their prey, for the despatch of which they are furnished
with a hard tubular beak, enclosing, as in a sheath,
a lancet-like instrument, which, being protruded at will,
severely lacerates the body of the captive. The beak, or
sheath, is also struck some way into the wound, and being
tipped with bristles, these serve as so many barbs to keep
it in position, whilst the blade continues to probe and
hack the victim, on whose back the fly has descended,
embracing it with its powerful legs. “These flies,” says
Dr. Fitch—who seems strangely unalive to the moral
beauty underlying the mere mechanical expression of it—“are
inhuman murderers, they are savages of the insect
world, putting their captives to death with merciless
cruelty. Their large eyes, divided into such a multitude
of facets, probably give them the most acute and accurate
vision for espying and seizing their prey; and their long,
stout legs, their bearded and bristly head, their whole
aspect indicates them to be of a predatory and ferocious
character. Like the hawk, they swoop upon their prey,
<a id='Page_58'></a>and grasping it securely between their fore feet, they
violently bear it away.”<a id='r17'></a><a href='#f17' class='c016'><sup>[17]</sup></a> Bees, beetles, butterflies, moths,
even grasshoppers are thus treated, and sometimes, by a
beautiful retributive arrangement—enough to throw one
into ecstasies—they turn cannibals, and prey upon each
other. Nay, there is even more than this to arouse our
admiration, for so stern and unbending is the law of
eternal justice, that even the softest feelings of nature are
not allowed to interfere with it, and the female, wooed
by the male, is frequently compelled to eat him. Thus
the noble maxim of <i><span lang="la">fiat justitia ruat cælum</span></i>, though, for
a time, it may seem to be in abeyance, finds, at last, unconscious
expression, if not in the breast, at least in the
appetite of a cruel and murderous insect; and thus in the
animal world, not less than in our human one, “the whirligig
of time brings in his revenges.”</p>

<p class='c017'>To bee-keepers—and to bees perhaps still more so—these
terrible buccaneer flies are especially obnoxious.
Poised in air, in the neighbourhood of some hive, they
watch the issuing and returning stream, and, making
swift choice of a victim, sweep, like the wingéd furies
that they are, upon him. There is a sharp, shrilly sound,
as the bee’s wings vibrate, for a moment, more rapidly,
then the fatal legs wrap her round, and, pressed tightly
to the oppressor’s body, she is borne to some shrub or
flower, in the shade or pleasant fragrance of which the
juices of her body are sucked out, through a hole specially
made to allow of their passage. When nothing remains
but the empty shell, the fly drops this, and returns to the
scene of its labours. Through all the hot sunny hours
these raids are continued, till hundreds of empty bee-shells
strew the ground. As the sun declines the sport flags
and gradually ceases, but it begins again the following
morning as merrily as ever. America seems to be the
home <i><span lang="fr">par excellence</span></i> of these flies, but they are represented,
under various forms, in many parts of the world. The
United States has been accorded its fair share of them,
and according to their numbers, each season, the labours
of the bee-farmer are rewarded or otherwise. So much
is this the case that the fact that “during certain seasons,
in a bee-raising district of New York, not a single hive
threw off a swarm”<a href='#f17' class='c016'><sup>[17]</sup></a> has been attributed to this cause
alone.</p>

<p><span class='small'>A BUCCANEER FLY, AND A LEAF-RESEMBLING INSECT.</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c002'>Poised in the air, the buccaneer fly selects its victim from the bees issuing from a hive, pounces
on it like a winged fury, and kills its hapless prey. The insect depicted beneath is
protected from its enemies by its strange resemblance to a dead leaf.</p>

<p class='c015'><a id='Page_59'></a>It would appear from these facts either that no bee
ever succeeds in stinging its assailant, or else that the
latter is proof against the injection of poison. The
former seems to me the most probable, since the system
of the bee itself has no such immunity. It seems
strange that so deadly a weapon should fail thus constantly,
at a pinch, and it would be interesting to know
if these redoubtable adversaries attack wasps as well as
bees. As it is not stated that they do so—as wasps are
pointedly omitted from the list made out of their victims—the
contrary may, I think, be assumed, and also, as a
corollary, that if wasps were attacked they would be able
to use their sting, probably with fatal effect. This
superior capability is, no doubt, owing to the superior
flexibility of a wasp’s abdomen over that of a bee; and
if we ask ourselves what is the cause of this—how and
for what reason the superiority has been acquired—the
<a id='Page_60'></a>answer seems “as ready as a borrower’s cap,” viz. “as
a means of self-defence through a process of natural
selection.” Nothing could be better adapted to bring
this process into play than the very ordeal through which
the bee is passing; for if some could only succeed, through
superior flexibility, in stinging the flies, they ought to
increase at the expense of those unable to do so. As far
as it goes, this seems to point to the wasp having gone
through a longer course of development than the bee—to
its ancestry dating farther back in time; but when we
think of the latter’s more elaborate social organisation
and the greater perfection of its cells, one feels inclined
to reverse this opinion. As no bees possess such powers
of twisting about and doubling round their abdomens as
do wasps, though some can do so in a very fair degree,
it seems probable that the common ancestor of all the
species was more thickly built than that of the wasps,
or at least that the potential capacity handed down by it
of development in this direction was less. But precisely
the same argument may be used in regard to the brain
of the ancestral wasp, and thus we see that unless we
have geological evidence on the subject it is very difficult
to say which of two species has the more ancient
descent.</p>

<p class='c017'>The Robber Flies—whose scientific name I have forgotten—however
disagreeable they may be, are at least
not parasites. They attack their prey and kill it quickly,
instead of handing it over to prolonged torture at the
hands of the next generation. This last is what the
Tachina flies—to say nothing of other kinds—do, who,
<a id='Page_61'></a>as they principally attack caterpillars, may be considered
beneficial to man. In the United States of America there
is no greater destroyer of all sorts of trees than the so-called
army-worm caterpillar, or rather grub—for it represents
a fly merely—which gathers together in enormous
numbers when about to enter the pupal state. “I have
seen,” says Mr. Leland Howard, “vast armies of the army-worm,
comprising, unquestionably, millions of individuals,
and have been unable to find a single specimen which did
not bear the characteristic eggs of a Tachina fly. These
flies were present in such numbers that their buzzing as
they flew over the army of caterpillars could be heard
at some distance, and the farmers were unnecessarily
alarmed, since they conceived the idea that the flies
were the parents of the caterpillars, and were flying
everywhere and laying their eggs in the grass and wheat.
As a matter of fact, one great outbreak of the army-worm
in northern Alabama in the early summer of 1881 was
completely frustrated by the Tachina flies, aided by a
few other parasites and predatory insects. They also
attack grasshoppers, bugs, beetles, saw-flies and saw-fly
larvæ, humble bees, and wasps. (How they avoid
the sting of the latter we are not told; perhaps their
insignificant size is a protection.) The eggs are stuck
by some sort of gummy substance to the surface of the
preyed-on insect; and the small white eggs are frequently
seen sticking to the back of some unfortunate caterpillar.
From the under side of each egg there hatches a little
maggot, which bores its way through the skin of the host,
and penetrates into its body, where it lives, nourishing
<a id='Page_62'></a>itself upon the fatty matter and lymph until it reaches
full growth, usually, if not always, destroying before
it emerges some vital organ, so as to cause the death
of the host insect. It almost invariably issues, when full
grown, from the body of the insect attacked, and pupates,
at or near the surface of the ground, within the last
larval skin, which hardens into a brown oval puparium.”<a href='#f17' class='c016'><sup>[17]</sup></a>
There are some points of special interest about the
parasitism of these Tachina flies, which seem to be
directed by a less perfect instinct than that which guides
other insects of similar habits; for instance, the Ichneumon
flies, which, however, are such merely in name, being
members of the order <i><span lang="la">Hymenoptera</span></i>, which includes the
bees and ants.</p>

<p class='c017'>These latter, by merely touching an insect with their
antennæ, can tell if it is already occupied—in which
case they withdraw—nor do they ever lay eggs in
excess of the number of issuing larvæ that can be supported
by the little world of provender into which they
will be born. Neither do they choose a caterpillar to
lay on, which is just about to cast its skin, by which
manœuvre the host would escape, and the guests be left
to perish. All these mistakes, however, are frequently
made by the Tachina fly, the consequence being that many
poor children die of starvation; whilst others, from wanting
their necessary complement of food, have their growth
checked and become poor pitiable objects, less than half
the size that, with a more generous diet, they would
certainly have attained to. It is painful to know that
such privation exists and to have no means of relieving
<a id='Page_63'></a>it; but nature is full of sadness, and it is best to look
truth in the face. Some comfort may perhaps be derived
by looking forward to a distant future, when the instinct
which is now liable to these errors shall have been perfected.
Such comfort, at any rate, lives in Mr. Leland
Howard’s views that “the parasitic mode of life in the
Tachina fly is one of comparatively recent acquirement,
and that sufficient time has not elapsed since they began
to take on this habit”<a href='#f17' class='c016'><sup>[17]</sup></a> to allow of its having reached the
final goal towards which it is always advancing. It is
difficult, however, to console oneself for the imperfections
of a work-a-day world in a far distant prospect of
Elysium.</p>

<p class='c017'>In the somewhat numerous list of insects distinguished
by the attentions of the Tachina fly, grasshoppers have
been mentioned. In Africa they, or, at any rate, one
species of the family, attack the terrible plague locust,
that has from time to time committed, and still apparently
commits, such terrible devastations. The latter
seems quite aware of the fate in store for it, and makes
vigorous efforts to evade its destiny. Buzzing in the air,
above the ravenous horde, the fly waits for one to hop
or rise on the wing, and then darts swiftly upon it. To
avoid her, the locust rises or sinks, tacks suddenly to
right or left, scudding this way and that like a ship to
meet a varying breeze. The Tachina, in the meanwhile,
circles about her quarry, awaiting a favourable opportunity,
which generally arises just as the locust alights,
or is on the point of alighting, when, descending upon it
before the lost impetus can be renewed, she clings lovingly,
<a id='Page_64'></a>and deposits her eggs, either on the neck or under one of
the wings,</p>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c015'>It is not, however, as a rule, till after the grub or grubs
have made their exit from the body that the locust dies,
though it has drooped and become languid for some time.
Of the vast swarms that darken the sky and descend upon
the country, like a mantle, a very small proportion would
seem to perish in this way, since everywhere the females
may be seen drilling with their abdomens into the ground,
preparatory to laying their eggs. The check upon their
numbers, whatever it may be—and on the whole it must
be very effective—supervenes, for the most part, at this
early stage, before the egg is hatched, that is to say.</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_0_4 c015'>LOCUSTS are insects famous in story, and when one
reads about them in various entomological or other
writings, one might imagine that the whole world
had been doing little else, ever since it began, than play
a losing match with these creatures. It is only after one
has gone a little about the world, and lived for some time
in regions noted as their head-quarters without seeing
anything whatever of them, that one begins to doubt this
view, and lean towards another one, viz. that they are
fabulous animals; but truth, as in other cases where two
extreme views are held, lies somewhere betwixt and between.
The whole matter is this, that when one reads
one narrative after another, with its burden of a darkened
sun, devastated territories, strong winds, drownings in the
sea, and pestilences engendered by innumerable carcases
cast up along hundreds of miles of beach, the intervals, as
well as the countries, between each one of these occurrences,
are annihilated in the imagination, and the dates,
if seen, are forgotten. Thus, to use the Kaffir expression—which
has not yet lost its meaning for a civilised European—one
sees everything red; locusts are very convincing—“you
may almost hear the beating of their wings.”</p>

<p class='c017'><a id='Page_66'></a>However, there is no doubt that these insects, in relation
to man, have played what the Germans call “<i>eine
bedeutende Rolle</i>” in the world, and are worth saying
something about, if only one has something not too
desperately antique to say, and this, by virtue of a work
which I, at any rate, have never seen quoted, and a paper in
a certain Antipodean organ, which for the majority of
people here might as well be in the <i>Faerie Queene</i> or
<i>Paradise Lost</i>, I think I may have. But first let us turn to
what, though it be antique, is also classical, and—though
this would not be a corollary for everyone—very delightful:
“To look,” say the authors of the famous <i>Introduction</i>,
“at a locust in a cabinet of insects, you would not, at
first sight, deem it capable of being the source of so much
evil to mankind as stands on record against it. ‘This
is but a small creature,’ you would say, ‘and the mischief
which it causes cannot be far beyond the proportion of its
bulk. The locusts so celebrated in history must surely be
of the Indian kind mentioned by Pliny, which were three
feet in length, with legs so strong that the women used
them as saws. I see, indeed, some resemblance to the
horse’s head, but where are the eyes of the elephant, the
neck of the bull, the horns of the stag, the chest of
the lion, the belly of the scorpion, the wings of the eagle,
the thighs of the camel, the legs of the ostrich, and the
tail of the serpent, all of which the Arabians mention
as attributes of this widely dreaded insect destroyer, but
of which, in the insect before me, I discern little or no
likeness?’” Personally, I do not for a moment imagine
that even in 1815, the date of the first edition of the
<a id='Page_67'></a>work in question, any reasonably educated person would
have spoken or thought in this way, without any conception,
apparently, of what numbers can effect, but it is interesting
to know what the Arabs think, or say, about
the locust, and especially that they represent it—as we
are told a few lines on—as thus addressing Mahomet:
“We are the army of the Great God; we produce
ninety-nine eggs; if the hundred were completed, we
should consume the whole earth and all that is in it.”</p>

<p class='c017'>The authors then proceed to give a short résumé of the
various locust plagues under which the earth, over a large
part of its surface, has at different times groaned. The
first and best authenticated goes back to a very early
period—about 4000 <span class='fss'>B.C.</span>—after which the evidence does
not conform quite so strictly to the test demanded of it
by the modern scientific spirit. Pliny, however, we are
told, “mentions a law in Cyrenaica by which the inhabitants
were enjoined to destroy the locusts in three
different states, three times in the year—first their eggs,
then their young, and lastly the perfect insect. And not
without reason was such a law enacted; for Orosius tells
us that in the year of the world 3800 Africa was infested
by such infinite myriads of these animals that having
devoured every green thing, after flying off to sea they
were drowned, and being cast upon the shore, they
emitted a stench greater than could have been produced
by the carcases of 100,000 men (a very confident statement,
surely). St. Augustine also mentions a plague as
having arisen in that country from the same cause,
which destroyed no less than 800,000 persons (<i><span lang="la">octingenta</span></i>
<a id='Page_68'></a><i><span lang="la">hominum millia</span></i>) in the kingdom of Masanissa alone, and
many more in the territories bordering upon the sea.”
After this we make a jump to <span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 591, and find the
locusts in Europe. In that year “an infinite army of
them, of a size unusually large, grievously ravaged part of
Italy; and, being at last cast into the sea, from their
stench arose a pestilence which carried off near a million
of men and beasts. In the Venetian territory also, in
1478, more than 30,000 persons” (but this seems pitiful)
“are said to have perished in a famine occasioned by
these terrific scourges.”</p>

<p class='c017'>Many other instances of their devastations in Europe,
in France, Spain, Italy, Germany, etc., are recorded by the
same authors. “In 1650 a cloud of them was seen to enter
Russia in three different places, which from thence passed
over into Poland and Lithuania, where the air was
darkened by their numbers. In some places they were
seen lying dead, heaped one upon another to the depth of
four feet; in others they covered the surface, like a black
cloth, the trees bent with their weight, and the damage
they did exceeded all computation.” Nay, “even this
happy island (<i><span lang="la">lucus a non lucendo</span></i>), so remarkably distinguished
by its exemption from most of those scourges
to which other nations are exposed (as fog, sunshine, etc.),
was once alarmed by the appearance of locusts. In 1748
they were observed here in considerable numbers, but
providentially they soon perished without propagating”—the
“happy island” apparently having been too much
for them. These unfortunates would appear to have been
stragglers from far vaster numbers which a year before had
<a id='Page_69'></a>devastated Eastern Europe, one swarm of which, “entering
Transylvania in August, was several hundred fathoms in
width. At Vienna the breadth of one of them was three
miles, and extended to so great a length as to be four
hours in passing over the Red Tower: and such was its
density that it totally intercepted the solar light, so
that when they flew low one person could not see another
at the distance of twenty paces.” Another host that
appeared in India is said to have formed a column five
hundred miles long, and “so compact was it when on the
wing that, like an eclipse, it completely hid the sun, so that
no shadow was cast by any object, and some lofty tombs
not more than 200 yards off were rendered quite invisible.”</p>

<p class='c017'>Dr. Clarke in his <i>Travels</i> speaks of locusts covering
“his carriage and horses, and says the Tartars assert that
people are sometimes suffocated by them.” He mentions
two species, “the first of which is almost twice the size of
the second, and, because it precedes it, is called by the
Tartars the herald or messenger.” From 1778 to 1780
a dreadful curse of locusts, alluded to by Southey in
his “Thalaba”—or, perhaps, forming the subject of
that poem—I really don’t know—fell upon the Empire of
Morocco. “Everything green was eaten up, not even the
bitter bark of the orange and pomegranate escaping. A
most dreadful famine ensued. The poor were seen to
wander over the country deriving a miserable subsistence
from the roots of plants; and women and children
followed the camels, from whose dung they picked the
undigested grains of barley, which they devoured with
avidity; in consequence of which numbers perished, and
<a id='Page_70'></a>the roads and streets exhibited the unburied carcases of
the dead.” Again, “From Mogador to Tangier, before the
plague of 1799, the face of the earth was covered by
them. At that time a singular incident occurred at El
Araiche. The whole region from the confines of the
Sahara was ravaged by them; but on the other side of the
river, El Kos, not one was to be seen, though there was
nothing to prevent their flying over it. Till then they
had proceeded northwards; but upon arriving at its
banks they turned to the east, so that all the country
north of El Araiche was full of pulse, fruits, and grain—exhibiting
a most striking contrast to the desolation of
the adjoining district.” Lastly—that is to say, to make a
last quotation from the classics—“The Arabs of the
Desert, whose hands are against every man, and who
rejoice in the evil that befalls other nations, when they
behold the clouds of locusts proceeding from the north,
are filled with gladness, anticipating a general mortality,
which they call <i>El Khere</i> (the benediction), for when a
country is thus laid waste they emerge from their arid
deserts and pitch their tents in the desolated plains.”</p>

<p class='c017'>Darwin, in his <i>Journal of Researches</i>, gives the following
account of a flight of locusts: “Shortly before we
arrived at the village of Luxan we observed to the south
a ragged cloud of a dark reddish-brown colour. At first
we thought that it was smoke from some great fire on the
plains; but we soon found that it was a swarm of locusts.
They were flying northward, and with the aid of a slight
breeze they overtook us at a rate of ten or fifteen miles an
hour. The main body filled the air from a height of
<a id='Page_71'></a>twenty feet to that, as it appeared, of two or three thousand
above the ground; ‘and the sound of their wings was
as the sound of chariots of many horses running to battle,’
or rather, I should say, like a strong breeze passing
through the rigging of a ship. The sky, seen through
the advanced guard, appeared like a mezzotinto engraving,
but the main body was impervious to sight; they were
not, however, so thick together but that they could escape
a stick waved backwards and forwards. When they
alighted, they were more numerous than the leaves in the
field, and the surface became reddish instead of being
green: the swarm having once alighted, the individuals
flew from side to side in all directions.” At that time—the
year was 1835—locusts were “not an uncommon
pest in this country: already during this season several
smaller swarms had come up from the south, where, as,
apparently, in all other parts of the world, they are bred
in the deserts. The poor cottagers in vain attempted by
lighting fires, by shouts, and by waving branches to avert
the attack.” This locust, Darwin tells us, closely resembled
the famous <i><span lang="la">Gryllus migratorius</span></i> of the East—the
one that spoke to the Prophet—if, indeed, it was not
identical with it.</p>

<p class='c017'>Though these accounts are all interesting in their way,
they none of them tell us much—or, indeed, anything—about
the locusts themselves, for which reason I will
supplement them with some which have that advantage,
and are also, in some sort, a check or commentary upon
the others. It is to be noted that, in all these, we hear
only of flying locusts, and anyone would imagine by reading
<a id='Page_72'></a>of them that it was by such, and no others, that all
the damage was done. In Africa, however, and also in
Cyprus—from which we may assume that it is the same
elsewhere—the case is widely different. Writing evidently
as a locust expert of the former country, Dr.
Æneas Munro tells us that it is in their early wingless
state—answering to the caterpillar one, though far less
differentiated from the perfect form—that the most
terrible, the overwhelming, injury is inflicted by these
insects. Of the full-grown flying locusts he says, “To a
certain extent, they do injure here and there, where they
select to settle and feed; but they do not devour everything
clean before them, like the army of the larval
stage or jumpers.”<a id='r18'></a><a href='#f18' class='c016'><sup>[18]</sup></a> Of the latter and its doings <i><span lang="la">ab ovo</span></i>
we have the following interesting account: “When the
tiny creatures issue from their nest they are of a greenish
white or creamy colour, about an eighth of an inch in
length,” and on the day that they do so “the very dust
of the ground, which was so still before, now seems to
waken into life. They begin to move by a process of
twisting or rolling over one another, so that, for the first
few days, they receive the name of twisters. Within
eight or ten days, however, they can jump four or six
inches, and at the age of three or four weeks a new
characteristic makes its appearance. A desire to explore
manifests itself, and in a surprising manner. The whole
company moves in a body in one general direction, and
more or less in a straight line, as if by one common
instinct, without apparently having any recognised leader
or commander,”<a href='#f18' class='c016'><sup>[18]</sup></a> which is just the way, in my opinion,
that rooks and starlings move.<a id='r19'></a><a href='#f19' class='c016'><sup>[19]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c017'><a id='Page_73'></a>Marching in this way they spread themselves out over the
country, “eating everything that comes in their way—wheat
(if sufficiently young and tender), maize (even if
strong and old), corn, sugar-cane, linseed, alfalfa (lucerne),
pasture of all kinds, vegetables of all kinds (tomatoes and
celery), and all garden produce, potatoes (ordinary and
sweet), the leaves and sometimes even the bark of the
trees, causing their ruin. The fruit, of course, is lost for
the season. Orange, willow, poplar, palm, banana, peach,
pear, plum, vine, acacia, roses, etc., are stripped,” but not
“the gum and paradise trees, which seem to be poisonous
to them. They make everything ‘clean bare’; sometimes
they will enter houses, and eat the very clothes and curtains
at the windows.”<a id='r20'></a><a href='#f20' class='c016'><sup>[20]</sup></a> They will even eat the wool off
the backs of the sheep, and “last stage of all that ends
this strange, eventful history,” on a pressing occasion they
will eat one another. Continuing his interesting account—the
graphic and convincing one of an eye-witness— Dr.
Munro tells us that “when these hoppers and jumpers
(<i><span lang="nl">voetgangers</span></i>, as the Boers call them) are on the march,
they sometimes appear so determined and bent on the
fearful execution of their work, that they resemble and
have got the name of ‘an army on the march.’ They move
in open file, and carry themselves in a proud, haughty
way, with heads high up and fixed. It is beautiful and
interesting to see them on the march, if we only divest
ourselves for the moment of the idea of their devastating
object.”<a href='#f20' class='c016'><sup>[20]</sup></a> And again, “The whole of the company
begin to walk at the same time, as if by order; the head
is kept erect, and the neck is as if stiffened. They go
<a id='Page_74'></a>straight on, irrespective of danger,”<a href='#f20' class='c016'><sup>[20]</sup></a> and are deterred, as
is well known, by hardly any obstacle. “The sight of
this army is a very impressive one, and once seen will
never be forgotten. In some respects it is an awful sight;
the spectacle strikes you with pity and sorrow to see at
once before you that the toil and the labour for the season,
or, indeed, the year, is lost.”<a href='#f20' class='c016'><sup>[20]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c017'>“It is in this marching stage,” continues Dr. Munro,
“that the <i><span lang="nl">voetgangers</span></i> do enormous damage and eat every
edible thing in their path, and completely destroy the
work of the husbandman. They are not content with
levying toll merely, but they will have all, and will leave
nothing behind but desolation. They are therefore unlike
the flying company of locusts, which only levy toll
here and there, but these, when they pass, leave nothing.”</p>

<p class='c017'>Some curious facts are then given in regard to the
uniform direction—varying according to the country—in
which these wingless locusts march. The account will be
remembered of how a flying host came to the banks of a
river which they refrained from crossing. One might
almost think that a mistake had here been made, and
that the locusts were really <i><span lang="nl">voetgangers</span></i>, but had they
been so, the river, unless a large one, need not have
deterred them—at least, they will pass streams, though
doubtless great numbers are sacrificed in doing so. If,
however, the stream had run parallel to the direction
in which the swarm was advancing, we can understand, in
the light of what seems to be now established, their not
crossing it.</p>

Australia—Strange ceremony of egg-laying—Inadequate explanation.</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_0_4 c015'>IN regard to the faculty of direction with which locusts
seem endowed, Dr. Munro says: “The flying locusts
in the Argentine come from a northerly direction, and
the hoppers or creepers march towards the south, although
it might be, so far as abundance of suitable food goes, to
their manifest advantage to go in an opposite direction.
In certain countries the direction may be known. In this
country (South Africa) it will be found that they march
towards the south, and not towards the north, east, or
west, though either of these directions might have been
better for them. The direction may not be true south;
it may incline at one time to the south-east, at another
to the south-west; but, taken as a whole, it will be southwards.”
And he adds: “If proof be needed that the
‘<i><span lang="pt">saltonas</span></i>,’ another name—perhaps the Portuguese one—for
these wingless armies, march in one direction, it is
abundantly found in the experience of the screen and
trap, or Cypriote system of destroying locusts, which is
<a id='Page_76'></a>based on this fact, and on this alone. This is conclusive
demonstration.”<a id='r21'></a><a href='#f21' class='c016'><sup>[21]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c017'>The distance that these footgangers—to translate,
almost without changing, the Dutch word—go in a day
depends upon the amount of food they find upon the
road, but fluctuates, as a rule, between one mile and two.
They start about eight o’clock, when the sun begins to
get hot; and halt for the night a little before the sun
sets. Dr. Munro describes the way in which the female
locust, before laying her eggs, drills a hole in the hard
ground with the disc-like extremity of her abdomen, but
he mentions nothing very peculiar in connection with the
laying of the eggs such as characterises the performance
of that ceremony by the Australian plague locust, as will
be mentioned shortly.</p>

<p><span class='small'>A PLAGUE OF LOCUSTS</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c002'>The dark cloud is entirely composed of locusts, which sometimes fill the air from twenty
feet to two or three thousand feet above the ground. The poor people attempt in vain,
by shouts, by lighting fires, and waving branches, to avert the attack.</p>

<p class='c015'>The first appearance of these locusts is in enormous
hosts, which may sometimes be seen at a distance of from
seven to ten miles, and then appear as a black cloud
in the clear and rarefied air of South Africa. “It is
impossible,” says Dr. Munro, “to estimate the number
of locusts in these clouds, but some idea may be formed
from the fact that when they are driven, as sometimes
is the case in a storm, into the sea, so many
are washed ashore that they lie on the beach as a
bank from three to four feet thick and from fifty to
one hundred miles in length, and the stench from the
corruption of their bodies, it is affirmed, is sensibly perceived
for a hundred and fifty miles inland.”<a id='r22'></a><a href='#f22' class='c016'><sup>[22]</sup></a> The aerial
movements of the locusts, when they fairly surround one,
are described as “curious, interesting, and pretty.” Distant
<a id='Page_77'></a>vision (more especially overhead) is impeded on
account of their numbers. The effect when you look
on them in the sun’s rays resembles “snow falling thickly
and gently,” and the sun is only seen as though it were
in eclipse. “Its light is darkened and shadows cannot
then be cast from it.”<a id='r23'></a><a href='#f23' class='c016'><sup>[23]</sup></a> The height at which the swarm
flies may be anything between forty feet and two miles
from the ground, but as a rule it is not greater than
400 feet, though from 500 to 800 is not uncommon.
Sometimes they fly by moonlight, but this is not their
usual practice. As in their earlier wingless state, they
seem to act by one common impulse, which prevents confusion.
It is obvious, indeed, that with such myriads
filling the whole air, a leader could neither be perceived
nor followed, and from my own observations I am convinced
that the same difficulty applies to this way of
explaining the movements of flocks of birds. I have
never, myself, seen any evidence of birds being led by one
or more of their number, but much to convince me that
when banded together, in numbers, their movements are
governed by a totally different principle, viz. that of
thought transference or thought-unity—collective thinking,
as I have elsewhere called it—for that is what it most
suggests. If this is not the case with locusts, what, I
would ask, is the alternative explanation? If great hosts
of men be neither led nor of one mind where to go, they
must fall into confusion, impeding one another’s movements,
and this is a law which has to do with numbers
merely, without respect to the species of which they
are composed. It has often been noticed, however, that
<a id='Page_78'></a>large crowds seem liable to be swayed suddenly by some
common impulse.</p>

<p class='c017'>Locusts may fly about a district all day doing but little
harm, “and at sundown,” says Dr. Munro, “the sight
becomes interesting beyond description, for the whole
company then appear to vie with one another in order
to roost quickly.”<a href='#f23' class='c016'><sup>[23]</sup></a> When all have found a resting-place,
“every twig, branch, bush, or separate stalk of the corn
or wheat or flax are completely covered, and sometimes
they stick to each other”<a href='#f23' class='c016'><sup>[23]</sup></a>—three or four deep even. “As
far as the eye can see, the surface assumes a brownish-red
hue. Pillars, posts, or the walls of houses are all alike
to them at the time of roosting for the night.”<a href='#f23' class='c016'><sup>[23]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c017'>Such, then, is the Plague Locust of South Africa,
which is, when at maturity, about three inches long.
Some years ago, however—the exact date is not given—a
larger and handsomer species made its appearance, and
is thus referred to in a letter which was sent by “A
Disgusted Farmer” of Grahamstown to one of the South
African papers: “The new red locust, which, during the
last month, has spread from the Orange River to the sea,
coming apparently from the north as well as from Natal,
is doing terrible damage. Everywhere fruit-trees are
being destroyed—quince, apricot, fig, orange, lemon,
naartje trees. Not only are the leaves eaten, but young
branches are all barked, so that they are probably killed.
A splendid crop of mealies, covering the whole of Peddie,
Lower Albany, Alexandria, and other districts, has been
entirely destroyed. Pumpkin plants are being eaten too.
Vegetables of all kinds—lucerne, cattle-cabbage, and
<a id='Page_79'></a>kale—are also swept away. The locusts are laying everywhere,
and, no doubt, the plague will continue some
years. What is the agricultural farmer to do?”<a href='#f23' class='c016'><sup>[23]</sup></a> I do
not know, but here, probably, were there locusts, he would
pick out all such birds as fed on them and try to get
them taken off the list of protected species, shooting
them illegally all the while he was petitioning.</p>

<p class='c017'>Dr. Munro’s work was published in 1900, and its
principal object was to induce the South African Government
to adopt the system of dealing with the locust
plague which had been practised with such entire success
in the isle of Cyprus. Whether this has since been done,
and with what results, I am unable to say. In Cyprus,
however, the locusts, which from the year 1600, especially,
have changed the country from a garden into a wilderness,
were in one season almost entirely swept away. The
method by which so great a result was effected is the
invention of an Italian gentleman—Signor Matthei by
name—resident in the island, and is based upon the inability
of the immature locusts, the footgangers—probably
the grown ones too, but this is immaterial—to
crawl up a smooth perpendicular, still more an overhanging
surface. Such a surface was supplied by a long
band of leather, glazed and polished, surmounting a strip
of calico, which was made about four feet high, but need
not, as it was afterwards found, have been more than two.
This insurmountable obstacle, supported at intervals by
sticks set in the ground—not upright, but slanting a
little towards the path of the locusts—was set up over a
large area of country like a miniature Chinese Wall, and
<a id='Page_80'></a>proved even more insurmountable. At intervals along
the inner side of the barrier deep pits were dug, whilst at
wider ones stood men provided with brooms, spades,
brushwood, and all else requisite. When the locusts
arrived at the Chinese Wall they climbed up the canvas
part of it, but being unable to pass the smooth band of
leather they fell down in heaps, and their ever-increasing
multitudes soon filled the pits, in which they were buried,
burnt, stamped down, or otherwise provided for. Afterwards
their carcases were dug out and heaped on carts,
and the pits, being empty again, were ready for more. In
this way two hundred million quadrillion billions—or
something of that sort—of locusts were destroyed, and
next year when everything was again ready for them
hardly any appeared. By this invention, as simple as it
is ingenious and inexpensive, the locust plague in Cyprus
has become a thing of the past, and if the conferrer of so
great a benefit was ever not a man of large fortune, let
us hope that that has become a thing of the past, too,
for he must have saved several to the British Government.
If the locusts, after coming to the Chinese Wall and finding
themselves unable to climb it, had turned round and
walked in another direction, this would have made a
capital instance of intelligence shown by insects—but
they did not do so.</p>

<p class='c017'>With native labour, the above system, which has been
so entirely successful in Cyprus, could, Dr. Munro makes
no doubt, be put in operation in Africa; but Mr. W. W.
Froggatt, the Government entomologist of Australia,
does not think it adapted for that country. Writing in
<a id='Page_81'></a><i>The Agricultural Gazette</i> of New South Wales (March,
1901), Mr. Froggatt says, “Though they have been
successfully dealt with in Cyprus, Egypt, Algeria, and
India by means of trenches, traps, and burning in the
hopper state, and digging up and destroying the eggs in
the earlier stage, in nearly all cases the areas infested
were comparatively small; the labour employed was so
cheap that small armies of natives could be employed at a
small cost to destroy them, while in several instances an
autocratic government made the natives, whether they
were inclined or not, work at their plan of destruction.”
In Australia, where, “whether they were inclined or not,”
the natives have been got rid of, very much as though
they were locusts—or some less stubborn insects—themselves,
this would not do.</p>

<p class='c017'>It was in the summer of 1899 that Mr. Froggatt, in
consequence of reports received of the advent of locusts in
various parts of the country, left Sydney for Condobolin.
On the way there many “mobs”—to use the Australian
word—were encountered, and numbers of locusts flew
in at the railway carriage windows. Upon alighting,
Mr. Froggatt became the witness of a very interesting
spectacle—a ceremony, as it may well be called, in which
vast numbers of the insects were engaged—of which he
gives the following description:—</p>

<p class='c017'>“In the open red soil we found them laying their eggs
in thousands, and the operation was very remarkable.
The female set to work by pressing the tip of her
abdomen into the soil, and working the plates at the
apex, so that she gradually bored a regular circular shaft,
<a id='Page_82'></a>slightly over an inch in depth and under a quarter of an
inch in diameter, the segments of the abdomen extending
and stretching as the work progressed. But the most
extraordinary part of the operation was that each female,
while boring the chamber to deposit the eggs, was
attended by two males, each of which rested his head
against hers, with his antennas resting over her head, and
the inner foreleg clasped over the prothorax behind the
base of the head. Resting like this, with the tails of the
two attendant males pointing outwards, the three formed
a three-rayed star. Wherever the business of egg-laying
was going on, each female and her attendants were surrounded
by a cluster of admiring males, averaging from
thirty to fifty in number, generally in bunches of fours or
fives, forming an irregular ring round them, but separated
from her by a clear space of three or four inches. In no
instance were there ever more than two males touching
the female, though we examined thousands of them at
work.”<a id='r24'></a><a href='#f24' class='c016'><sup>[24]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c017'>What is the meaning of this odd performance?—this
ceremony, as it appears to me, though Mr. Froggatt takes
a utilitarian view of it. “The probable and only
reason,” he remarks, “that I can see for the attendance
of the two males upon the egg-laying female is that it
enables her to get a firmer grip of the ground, and, in
fact, holds her in position till she completes her task.”<a href='#f24' class='c016'><sup>[24]</sup></a>
But why, then, should the females of no other species of
locust, as far as we are aware, require this aid, and should
not the soil of Africa be as hard as that of Australia?
“I can find,” says Mr. Froggatt, “no record of this habit
<a id='Page_83'></a>in any of our described species, which have the same
habits.”<a href='#f24' class='c016'><sup>[24]</sup></a> Again, besides the two chief actors, we have the
admiring ring of from thirty to fifty males, who can be of
no possible service, but whose conduct shows that they
take a strong interest in what the female is doing. What
is it, too, that regulates the number, or, at any rate, the
personality of the assistant males? If it is a matter of
rendering assistance only, and the two males who do so are
bound to the female by no more special tie than the
crowd of interested spectators, why do not these, or some
of them, push forward? Why is there never any contention
between them? These considerations make me
think that there is something of a formal and ceremonious
character about these queer proceedings, and
that they are governed by the same general law as are
certain antics or set figures amongst birds, wherein three
individuals take a part. What one requires to know is
the courting and marital relations of the male and female
locust before the egg-laying takes place.</p>

<p class='c017'>These little locusts—<i><span lang="la">Epacromia terminalis</span></i> is the specific
name—are only about an inch in length, and the male,
from the description, seems a little brighter than the
female, which may be due to sexual selection. The
female appears to lay nineteen eggs only, neither more
nor less, which is not so many as one would have expected
from the Arabian legend. With some other
species, however, the number more conforms to the statement
said to have been made to Mahomet.</p>

<p class='c017'>There is no vanity at all in my thinking that this
has been an interesting account of locusts, since I myself
<a id='Page_84'></a>have had nothing to do with it. In giving a general description,
from general reading, of things generally known,
and that have been described scores of times before, one is
entitled to use one’s own language, and to think, perhaps,
that one stands at no particular disadvantage in doing so.
But when, in regard to something specially curious or
interesting, the graphic words of an eye-witness are before
one, the best thing one can do, in my opinion, is to copy
them out. If it be suggested that this is but a lazy way
of writing a book, my reply is that a compiler best shows
his industry in the searching out of material. The late
Professor Romanes was alive to this fact, and has left
us in consequence his <i>Animal Intelligence</i>—one of the
most interesting books that exist, in my opinion—about
one-eighth of which, or perhaps a little more, is written by
himself.</p>

<p class='c014'>Locusts and <i><span lang="la">locustidæ</span></i>—The most musical grasshoppers—Katydid
concerts—A much-resembling note—Cricket thermometers—Cicadas
and sounding-boards—Admired musicians—An appreciative
audience.</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_0_4 c015'>LOCUSTS, as everybody knows, belong to the grasshopper
family, but it may surprise some who have
read the grumblings of the learned over popular
names—white ants, hedge-sparrows, etc.—to find that
entomologists have so managed matters that they do not
belong to the <i><span lang="la">locustidæ</span></i>—which is one of the two groups
into which all grasshoppers are divided—but to the other
group. There are long-horned grasshoppers and short-horned
grasshoppers. The long-horned ones, which are
not locusts, are all of them <i><span lang="la">locustidæ</span></i>, but none of the
<i><span lang="la">locustidæ</span></i> are locusts, because locusts have short horns.
Entomologists think it would be absurd to alter this,
after it has gone on so long, a view in which ornithologists,
with their <i>storm</i>-petrels and hedge-<i>accentors</i>, no doubt
agree with them. A mere popular name, with its roots
in the Saxon or Celtic, can be changed, and there an end,
but scientific nonsense, in Latin, and begun by Linnæus,
as is generally the case, let no man presume to meddle
with.</p>

<p class='c017'>It is amongst the <i><span lang="la">locustidæ</span></i> that we find the most
<a id='Page_86'></a>musical of the grasshoppers, the Katydids—so well known
and highly appreciated in the United States—standing on
a far higher level in this respect than the comparatively
unmusical locusts. Not that the <i><span lang="la">locustidæ</span></i>—however
musical—use their long horns for blowing purposes.
Properly speaking, these are only antennæ, and function
as such, the musical apparatus being situated elsewhere.
The Katydids, for instance, rasp their fore wings against
each other, according to the general idea, three times
in succession, producing the three syllables, Ka—ty—did,
which have given the insect its name, but according to
Mr. Scudder<a id='r25'></a><a href='#f25' class='c016'><sup>[25]</sup></a> only twice, which makes either “Katy,”
or “She did”; that is to say, as a general rule, for
he admits the three on occasions. The notes are uttered
with great emphasis, and at the rate of some two hundred
in the minute, the performance continuing, at least in the
case of some species, all day and all night long.</p>

<p class='c017'>A number of grasshoppers go by the name of Katydids
in America, but the general type of the insect is a graceful,
green, fragile-looking creature, with very long, slender
antennæ, and, in the female, a long ovipositor at the
other end, as if to balance matters. There are many
species, and all, or most of them, sing both by night and
day, and what is very remarkable, or, at least, very interesting,
they have a different note for either. Speaking
of one—or, rather, of a long-horned grasshopper nearly
related to the Katydids, but not actually a member of the
sisterhood—which he had been watching in the sunshine,
Mr. Scudder says: “As a cloud passed over the sun he
suddenly changed his note to one with which I was already
<a id='Page_87'></a>familiar, but without knowing to what insect it belonged.
At the same time, all the individuals around, whose
similar day-song I had heard, began to respond with the
night-cry. The cloud passed away, and the original note
was resumed on all sides.”<a id='r26'></a><a href='#f26' class='c016'><sup>[26]</sup></a> <i><span lang="la">Scudderia angustifolia</span></i> is
the name of this little musician, so called, perhaps, because
so sensitive to scudding clouds. But the Katydids
do more than merely play an individual tune, each on
his own instrument. They hold concerts, at which many
join together to make an elaborate musical display, a
certain number commencing on one note, and others
joining in harmoniously on another. There are leaders,
whose business it is to hold the time-measure, and, by
a steady insistence on the right note, to draw back any
who may happen for a moment to get out of tune. The
orchestra is divided into so many companies, who support
and assist one another, so that the whole makes a concerted
harmony, in which there are many different movements.
As a rule the performance is most creditable, though
occasionally the effect is marred by a careless player.
Before commencing, the company always tunes up.</p>

<p class='c017'>Possibly it may be thought that there is some mistake
here—that things cannot be quite like this. Personally
I have no knowledge on the subject—never having been
to America—but here is what Dr. George M. Gould says,
writing in <i>Science</i> for October or November, probably
1895, since the number is referred to as “recent” in
<i>Nature</i> for December 5th of that year. “As soon as the
sun has set and twilight is advancing, the Katydids in the
trees begin to ‘tune up.’ The first notes are scattered,
<a id='Page_88'></a>awkward and without rhythm, but if no wind is blowing
thousands soon join in, and from time to time, until
daylight breaks, there is no intermission.... In order
to make my description clearer, let us suppose a thousand
Katydids, scattered through the trees, to utter their
several notes all at once, and call them Company A.
Another thousand—Company B—at once answers them,
and this swing-swong is kept up, as I say, all night.
Company A’s note is the emphatic or accented note, and
is more definitely and accurately a precise musical note,
whilst the note of Company B varies from one to five
half-tones below, the most conspicuous note being five.
In the old-fashioned musical terms I learned as a boy,
Company A is, <i>e.g.</i>, clearly and definitely <i>do</i>, while the
note of Company B is either <i>la</i>, or more certainly <i>sol</i>.
Not only is Company A’s note more unisonal and definite,
but it is firmer, more accented, and it seems to me that
more insects join in this note than in the second. Careful
observation has convinced me that no insect of Company A
or Company B ever joins in the other company’s note.
The rhythm is usually perfect, unless there is a disturbance
by a breeze. A sharp gust upsets the whole
orchestra, and confusion results, but the measured beat
is soon refound. In the instants of confusion one can
detect the steady see-saw of certain ones, as it were,
‘leaders,’ or first violinists, who hold the time-measure,
despite the wind, and who soon draw the lost notes of the
others once more into the regular measure or beat. I do
not mean to say that by diligent attention one may not
at times detect individuals sawing out of tune, stray
<a id='Page_89'></a>fellows that are indifferent or careless, but the vast
majority, usually even without a single exception, if there
is no wind or rain, thus swing along, hour after hour, in
perfect time. I have counted the beats several times, and
find the number is always identical: thirty-four double
beats, or sixty-eight single ones, in sixty seconds. The
effect of the rhythm upon the mind is not unlike that
of the woodman’s cross-cut saw, handled by two steady,
tireless pairs of hands, although the Katydids give a
larger volume of sound, and the <i>timbre</i> is harsher.” Such
is the account, and upon it Dr. Gould asks two questions:
“What function does the orchestration subserve?” and
“Is there anything comparable to it among other
animals?”</p>

<p class='c017'>In view of these performances of the Katydids one may
perhaps question the statement, often made, that crickets
are <i>the</i> most musical of all insects. The Snowy Cricket,
however, of the United States, and no doubt elsewhere in
America, is a very striking performer, especially at night,
when it emits sounds which Nathaniel Hawthorne has
likened to “audible stillness,” and of which he says: “If
moonlight could be heard it would sound like that.”
Thoreau describes it as a “slumbrous breathing,” but
according to the State Entomologist of the United States,
this “slumbrous breathing,” or “audible stillness,” consists
of “a shrill re-teat, re-teat, re-teat,” which Mr. Leland
Howard,<a href='#f26' class='c016'><sup>[26]</sup></a> indeed, thinks the best description, but is not
quite my idea—nor probably Hawthorne’s—of how moonlight
would sound. Harrington—who I suppose is another
entomologist—does not interfere with any of these opinions,
<a id='Page_90'></a>but describes something which he has seen, and can find
nothing about in books. “While the male,” he says,
“is energetically shuffling together his wings, raised
almost vertically, the female may be seen standing just
behind him, and with her head applied to the base of
the wings, evidently eager to get the full benefit of every
note produced.”<a href='#f26' class='c016'><sup>[26]</sup></a> No doubt the female likes the notes—that,
indeed, is the <i>rationale</i> of their utterance—but what
they are really like it is impossible to make out from
these various descriptions, another of which, by the way,
is “a rhythmic beat.” Possibly they are no more extraordinary
(at any rate, “re-teat” is not) than those of our
own, and cheerful, house-cricket, which to my ear have
always sounded very pretty, but which Cowper evidently
did not care about except as a matter of association,
since he thus alludes to them in the <i>Task</i>:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c018'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Sounds inharmonious in themselves and harsh,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Yet heard in scenes where peace for ever (<i>sic</i>) reigns,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>And only there, please highly for their sake.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c015'>No doubt there are associations, though these, belonging
to the kitchen, appear to me to be of another and blither
description, but the “sounds” themselves, in my opinion,
are neither harsh nor inharmonious, as far as any unpleasantness
to the ear is conveyed by the last word.</p>

<p class='c017'>One interesting point about the song of crickets is that
the number of notes uttered in any given space of time—per minute,
say—varies according to the temperature, the
two rising together. Professor Dolbeare was the first, as
far as I know, to call attention to this fact, and he is thus
<a id='Page_91'></a>confirmed by a lady: “One cool evening a cricket was
caught and brought into a warm room. In a few minutes
it began to chirp nearly twice as rapidly as the out-of-door
crickets. Its rate very nearly conformed to the
observed rate maintained on other evenings under the
same temperature conditions (as now indoors). From this
series of observations we found that the rate of chirping
was, as Professor Dolbeare says, very closely dependent on
the temperature.”<a id='r27'></a><a href='#f27' class='c016'><sup>[27]</sup></a> So the crickets are little thermometers—sixty-three
degrees Fahrenheit to one hundred
chirps per minute.</p>

<p class='c017'>As we have seen, the Katydids give concerts, and we
may therefore infer that they like their own music in
a musically appreciative way; that they listen to each
other as critical connoisseurs, whether they have other
feelings or not, and that it is not a mere matter of the
female alone admiring the sounds made by the male, just
because <i>he</i> makes them. In all this, however, the admiration
is confined—at least, as far as we know—to one
species—that to which the musician belongs. Katydids
appreciate the performances of Katydids. But there is
one group of performers whose music gives satisfaction,
not merely to individuals of other species than their own,
but to such as are not even included in the same order
with them, so that racial pride or family prejudice cannot
be the reason of it. Towards these stars we will now turn
our gaze.</p>

<p class='c017'>All who have lived in the more southern parts of the
world, including the southern countries of Europe, must
have made the acquaintance of the cicadas, for in these
<a id='Page_92'></a>regions they are large insects, conspicuous by their appearance
when once seen, and by their song long before they
are noticed. There is something very uncouth—one might
almost say grotesquely humorous—yet at the same time
pleasing and lovable about the broad flat heads and great
goggle eyes of these insects, in the which it is easy to
imagine some quaint sort of expression that seems to
mean or suggest something for which the language supplies
no word. Their wings, both long and broad, which,
when folded, project far beyond the extremity of the
abdomen, concealing everything save the great head and
the wide shield or boss of the thorax, help also in giving
them a most salient and characteristic appearance, and
make them look more aerial than they really are. Their
legs, whilst they retain their ordinary resting attitude,
are entirely hidden, and so too are the organs of the
mouth, which combine to make a sharp-pointed beak.
Thus their appearance is typical of air and sunshine, and
anything so gross as mere feeding or terrestrial locomotion
seems foreign to their nature. The ancients, who
loved and admired the cicadas extremely, thinking them
the most fortunate of creatures, supposed that they lived
entirely on dew.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c018'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Oh Tettix, drunk with sipping dew,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>What musician equals you?”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c015'>sings Anacreon, or someone who imitated him and wrote
very gracefully, for Tettix was a common Greek name for
the cicada. Really they live on the sap of the trees on
which they sit, and there may even be two opinions about
<a id='Page_93'></a>their music. To me it is pleasant enough—full of the joy
of the sunshine, as it were, and its loudness and the continuous
way in which it goes on excites one’s wonder. In
regard to the way in which it is produced, Darwin says,
at page 351 of his immortal work, <i>The Descent of Man</i>:
“The sound, according to Laudois, who has recently
studied the subject, is produced by the vibration of the
lips of the spiracles, which are set in motion by a
current of air emitted by the tracheæ. It is increased by
a wonderfully complex resounding apparatus, consisting
of two cavities covered with scales. Hence the sound
may truly be called a voice. In the female the musical
apparatus is present, but very much less developed than
in the male, and is never used for producing sound.” As
the Greeks, who must have had their observers, used to
say—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c018'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Happy the cicadas’ lives,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Since they all have voiceless wives.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c015'>This sounds all right—I mean the account of the
apparatus—but according to Dr. Powell, of New Zealand,
it is all wrong. Writing in the <i>Transactions of the
New Zealand Institute</i>,<a id='r28'></a><a href='#f28' class='c016'><sup>[28]</sup></a> Dr. Powell, after quoting the
above passage, says, “I am, of course, ignorant of the
details of his description; but unless the cicada which
he describes differs essentially in the nature of its musical
organs from those found in New Zealand, and also from
those described more or less correctly by other authors,
especially Réaumur, he is most certainly in error.” Dr.
Powell, then, after telling us that the stridulating organs
of the cicada are constructed on a principle unique in
<a id='Page_94'></a>nature, viz. a vibrating membrane, continues: “In the
male, on the upper surface of the first ring of the abdomen,
on either side, may be seen a crescent-shaped opening,
and on examining this opening with a magnifying-glass
it will be seen to lead into a shallow cavity, closed
in by a horny membrane. This membrane is highly
elastic, and the sound is produced by the contraction of
the muscle straightening out the folds of the membrane;
this produces a click and, on the muscle relaxing, the
membrane, from its elasticity, springs back with another
click.” That this is really the way in which the sounds
are produced seems proved by the fact that “if a live
insect be caught, and these membranes be observed during
the act of stridulation, they will be seen to be vibrating
rapidly in time with the beats of the shrill sound.”</p>

<p class='c017'>But what about the “wonderfully complex resounding
apparatus, consisting of two cavities covered with scales”?
After a full examination and various experiments, Dr.
Powell arrives at the unexpected conclusion that the
sound is in no way dependent upon these “large transparent,
drum-like membranes,” as he calls the cavities in
question. I was “much surprised,” he says, “to find that
the large drums seemed to take no part in the production
of the sound, and the idea occurred to me that they
might be hearing organs; but on examining the females,
which are dumb and do not possess the stridulating
organs, I found that the drums exist, indeed, but are
quite rudimentary instead of being large, as we should
expect to find them, were they subservient to the sense
of hearing.” If, however, the drums did answer the purpose
<a id='Page_95'></a>of a resounding apparatus in the male, we should
expect to find them exactly as they are in the female,
and so strong does the evidence of their suppression in
her appear to me, that I cannot help thinking that, in
spite of all Dr. Powell’s observations and experiments, he
was somehow mistaken, and that in nature they do act
in this way.</p>

<p class='c017'>As to the quality of the sound produced by the cicada—of
its song, as we may call it—this varies greatly in
the different species, for there are many cicadas. Speaking
of that of the largest—the great <i><span lang="la">Pomponia imperatoria</span></i>
of Borneo—as big as a mouse, one may almost say,
Mr. Annandale remarks, “The sound produced by this
species is, at the beginning of the song, like the winding
up of a large clock, and ends by being comparable to the
notes of a penny whistle. Between these extremes it
rises in a series of trills, each of which concludes with a
kind of click. Each section of the song is faster, louder,
and clearer than the one which preceded it, until, almost
five minutes after the cicada’s settling, the noise suddenly
comes to an end as the insect flies off to another tree,
where it commences again.”<a id='r29'></a><a href='#f29' class='c016'><sup>[29]</sup></a> This great pompous
imperial insect—to give it a free rendering of its Latin
name—sits shrouded in the mysteries of the deeper
jungle, while smaller and less majestic babblers haunt its
skirtings and the village groves. “Another species,
commonly heard at night in the jungle, has a clear,
loud, clarion-like call, which can be heard for a great
distance.”<a href='#f29' class='c016'><sup>[29]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c017'>Of the three New Zealand species of cicada—or those
<a id='Page_96'></a>found in Canterbury—a large and small green, and a black
one, the two first, Dr. Powell tells us, say “crrrk-crrrk-crrrk,”
the second “r-r-r-r-r-r,” and the third “crrrk-rrrrr,”
<i><span lang="la">ad infinitum</span></i>. “Many persons,” he adds, “are
totally unable to hear the voice of the small green cicada,
or any very acute sounds, and inasmuch as the entire
range of the human ear is, according to Helmholtz,
eleven octaves, it has been justly remarked that the air
may be filled with shrill insect sounds, which may be perfectly
audible to the insects themselves, but absolutely inaudible
to our grosser senses.”<a id='r30'></a><a href='#f30' class='c016'><sup>[30]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c017'>It is in Natal—at least, the fact has been observed
there—that the cicadas, as they sing, are listened to by
admiring groups of other insects. These appear to be
beautiful creatures, having wings of a soft, gauzy texture,
but iridescent, and shot with the colours of the rainbow.
A band of these radiant attendants, consisting sometimes
of a dozen or fifteen, fly to the tree where a cicada is
sitting and arrange themselves in a semicircle around it,
facing its head. They are “all ear” evidently, and, as
the sweet sounds continue, one or other of the listeners
will advance and touch the antennæ or legs of the object
of its admiration. Such marks of appreciation, however,
though flattering in proportion to their undoubted
sincerity, are not to the taste of the cicada, who will
sometimes, whilst in the midst of its song, strike out
vigorously with a foot or so—for, of course, it has six—causing
its too obtrusive admirers to retreat to a more
respectful distance, where they continue to listen with
every sign of being extremely pleased.<a id='r31'></a><a href='#f31' class='c016'><sup>[31]</sup></a> Some years ago
<a id='Page_97'></a>we did not even know the name of these musical-connoisseur-like,
and withal very beautiful insects, but now
they have been identified by Mr. Kirby, at the British
Museum, as <i><span lang="la">Nothochrysa gigantea</span></i>, so we are all much the
wiser, and have a weight lifted from our minds.</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_0_4 c015'>THE Greeks thought that the life of the cicadas
was all joy, but modern research has been successful
in removing the reproach of inconsistency from the
general scheme of creation. All is in order, as it now
appears: the cicada’s case has been considered, and a very
handsome wasp provided for it. At least, I think it is
handsome. It is large and strong, I know, as is necessary
for the part it has to perform, but I cannot quite remember
the colours it flies under; an expression which,
though metaphorical, may be pardoned, since flags have
much to do with such dramas as that now to be described.
For as the joyous, sun-loving creature sits in its accustomed
place, chirupping forth those shrill yet musical
notes which I, at least, have never wearied of, the destroyer
is at hand, and settling on its broad back, curves
its abdomen beneath that of the poor blithe singer,
and in a moment has done its work. As the sting enters,
the happy note that has been sounding regularly for the
last hour, perhaps, is changed to a discordant scream of pain,
<a id='Page_99'></a>and with a spasmodic spring or flutter—the last, or near
the last, that it will ever make—the cicada, with the wasp
still clinging to it, falls to the ground. This is awkward
for the wasp, who doubtless considers herself aggrieved in
the matter, since the cicada is so bulky that, powerful as
she is, she can neither lift it from the ground in flight,
nor is she prepared to drag it all the way to her burrow.
What, then, is she to do, or of what use to her is the
prize she has obtained with such adroitness? But she
has her plan, and though the captious behaviour of the
cicada has, for the moment, a little deranged it, it is
not permanently frustrated. Slowly, but with firm insistence,
she drags her victim to the tree on which a moment
before it was so happily seated, and then exerting all her
force, begins to mount the trunk with it. Often she has
to pause and rest, often it seems as though the task would
be beyond her, but she continues the laborious ascent,
sometimes for upwards of an hour, until at last a height
has been reached at which it is possible for her to put her
great project into execution. This is no other than to fly
down obliquely, with her victim clasped in her arms, to
the pleasant little sarcophagus which she has previously prepared
for it, for though flight upwards, or in a straight line,
with such a burden, is out of the question, her strength is
equal to this. It is necessary, however, that she should
balance the body nicely, and make a fair and uninterrupted
start, in order not to be overweighted and again fall.
Her enterprise is “full of poise and difficult weight,” and
cannot be successfully carried out in face of the rude
struggles of a tiresome obstructive not “in tune with the
<a id='Page_100'></a>infinite.” These struggles, however, have now ceased; the
cicada is in a comatose condition, and, having adjusted it
properly, and assumed the requisite attitude and position,
our wasp—whose scientific name, by the way, is <i>Sphecius
speciosus</i>—launches herself, with “the white man’s burden”
she has “taken up,” from her coign of vantage, and
reaches home with it in safety. How high she has
previously ascended the tree I cannot say, since my informant
does not, but it would be interesting to ascertain
both this and the average distance which she has to fly to
her nest, and to compare the one with the other. Unless
the latter is very much greater than the former—and as
the journey is constantly downwards it cannot, one would
think, be very far—then we must see in the wasp’s choice
of a toilsome ascent up a perpendicular tree-trunk, in
preference to a horizontal journey along the ground, a
triumph of instinct over intelligence, and it is, indeed,
quite possible that, having always been accustomed to fly
back with her prize, which perhaps was not always so
heavy, she should go through as much labour to enable
her to do this as, differently directed, would attain the
end for which it is employed.</p>

<div class='ic002'>
<p><span class='small'>A WASP BEARING OFF A CICADA.</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c002'>After the wasp has killed the cicada, they both fall to the ground. Strong as the wasp is it is
not easy for her to carry such a heavy insect to her nest. But she has her plan. Slowly
but persistently she drags her victim to a tree-trunk and up it, though it may take her an
hour to reach the requisite height. Then she sails off for her nest on an inclined plane,
with wings extended, and her victim clasped in her arms.</p>

<p class='c015'>The burrow of this wasp consists, we are told, “of a
gently sloping entrance, extending for about six inches,
when, ordinarily, a turn is made at right angles, and the
excavation is continued for six or eight inches farther,
ending in a globular cell an inch and a half in diameter.
Frequently a number of branches leave the main burrow
at about the same point, each terminating in a round
cell.”<a id='r32'></a><a href='#f32' class='c016'><sup>[32]</sup></a> In each of these cells either one or two cicadas are
<a id='Page_101'></a>deposited, and it would seem that when there are two,
only one of these is provided with an egg, so that
some of the wasp-larvæ have double rations. As the
female <i><span lang="la">speciosus</span></i> (her arguments, I think, would need
to be specious to make one in love with a scheme in
which she plays such a part) is very much larger than
the male, it seems more than probable that the female
eggs are laid in the chambers which contain two
cicadæ, and the male ones in those which accommodate
a single one only. If so, then these solitary wasps
must have the same control over the sex of the eggs laid
by them as the queen bee has. The social ones, should this
be the case, no doubt have, too, but as the former must
have preceded the latter, it would appear that this power
has not been developed to meet the needs of a complex
state of society—as has been generally supposed—but in
accordance with much more simple conditions. The fact,
however, if it be one, has not yet been demonstrated.</p>

<p class='c017'>“The delicate white, elongate egg of the wasp is laid
under the middle leg of the cicada, and when it hatches,
the larva protrudes its head and begins at once to draw
nourishment from between the segments of its victim.
The egg hatches in two or three days, and the larva
attains full growth in a week, or a little more. It feeds
entirely from the outside, and, when full-grown, spins
a white silken cocoon (mixed with much earth, however),
which is finished at the expiration of two days. It
remains in the cocoon, unchanged, through the winter,
transforming to pupa only in the following spring, and
shortly before the appearance of the true insect. When
<a id='Page_102'></a>the adult hatches it gnaws its way out of the cocoon, and
so on up through the burrow to the surface of the ground,
thus completing its life-round in a full year.”<a href='#f32' class='c016'><sup>[32]</sup></a> How long,
exactly, the life of the cicada lasts after it has entered
into hospitable relations with the <i><span lang="la">speciosus</span></i> I am unable
to say.</p>

<p class='c017'>Such, then, is the end of the cicada, in spite of the
love of Apollo, who, according to the Anacreontic ode,
bestowed upon it its shrill song. Thus it dies, though
“cherished by the Muses, painless and fleshless, almost
equal to the gods.” Whether it be fleshless <i><span lang="la">speciosus</span></i>, in
the larval state, best knows (on the latter point there will
have been no means of comparison), that it is painless one
can only hope. It is something, however, to be so known
to fame. Homer himself alludes to the cicada in terms
of respect, calling its shrill song “delicate music,” whilst
Hesiod tells of “the dark-winged Tettix, when he begins
to sing to men of the coming summer; he whose meat and
drink is of the refreshing dew, and who all day long
and at break of day pours forth his voice.”</p>

<p class='c017'>There was no end, apparently, to the love of the ancients—especially
the Greeks—for the cicadas, or tettiges—for
they were known by both names—or to the graceful
things they said of them. From poets and philosophers
down to ploughmen, all were equally fond of them. “We
bless thee, Tettix,” says a poet whose name has been merged
in that of one who is now a name only, though a great one—Anacreon,
namely—“We bless thee for that seated on
the tree-tops, sipping the dew, thou singest royally....
Oh, sweetest of summer prophets! honoured by mortals,
<a id='Page_103'></a>thou art cherished by the Muses. Phœbus himself loves
thee, and gave thee thy shrill song”; and Plato tells us that
“as music soothes the mind and dissipates fatigue, so the
ploughman loves and cherishes the cicada for its song.”
The Greek ploughman, apparently, was a less gross embodiment
than the one of the present day, after twenty-five
centuries or so of improvement. To Apollo the
cicadas were sacred, because they “everlastingly sang to
the sun,”<a id='r33'></a><a href='#f33' class='c016'><sup>[33]</sup></a> and, for the Muses, they had once supplied
their place. “As the story goes,” says Plato, “before the
Muses lived the cicadas were men on earth, and so loved
song and singing that, to lose no time from it, they left
off eating, and so died of that dear delight. But, in
death, they became cicadas, and this boon was granted
them by the Muses, lately born, that on earth they should
eat no more, but only sing until they died again, and that
then they should return to the Muses to tell them who,
amongst mortals, loved and worshipped them most.” “A
lover of music like yourself,” says Socrates in the “Phædrus”
of Plato, addressing one of <i>his</i> worshippers, “ought
surely to have heard this story of the cicadas, how they
were once human beings, but died through forgetting to
eat. But now, dear to the Muses, they hunger no more,
thirst no more, but sing only, from their birth. And in
heaven they tell Terpsichore of the dancers, Erato of the
lovers, Calliope, eldest of the nine, and Urania, of those
whose heart is in philosophy—and thus they whisper to
them all.”</p>

<p class='c017'>So established were these and similar stories that, in
<a id='Page_104'></a>Greece, a cicada perched on a harp was often engraved
upon gems as the symbol of the Muses, and, were there
a musical contest, one had only to settle on the lyre or
pipe of the competitor it favoured, for the prize to be
instantly adjudged to that one—since Apollo was then
held to have spoken. Only in the absence of such indication
were other methods of forming a conclusion
resorted to. In common with other graceful creatures,
cicadas were often kept as pets by the Greeks, and that
mausoleums were sometimes raised to these favourites we
know from the following epigram of the poetess Anytie—written
probably for the friend it celebrates:—“For a
grasshopper, a nightingale of the fields, and for an oak-haunting
cicada Myro has built one common tomb.
There the maiden sits and weeps for three pets, torn
from her by unrelenting Hades.”</p>

<p class='c017'>Amongst the Athenians the cicadas were looked upon
as children of the soil of Attica, and those only who, like
them, had been born upon it, were permitted to twist the
golden tettix, or bodkin, amidst their flowing locks, thus
forming the knot in which they were accustomed to wear
them. This privileged bodkin received its name through
being surmounted with the head, in gold, of a cicada, or
tettix, and the wearers—or bearers—of these insignia—which
were strictly forbidden to strangers—were known
for this reason as Tettigophori. They were most proud
of the distinction, and, indeed, as it showed them to be
Athenians, they had a somewhat better right to be than
is common in such cases. Yet, amidst all this praise, we
meet, here and there, with a dissentient note. Hercules,
<a id='Page_105'></a>for instance, feeling inclined to sleep, once, on the banks of
the river, opposite where the town of Locris stood, and
not being able to, on account of the perpetual singing of
the cicadas, took it so seriously that he prayed to the gods
to put a stop to their disturbing him. The gods, with
whom Hercules was always a favourite, heard his prayer,
and cicadas, from that time, ceased to sing opposite Locris,
though they swarmed all round about that town. Here
it seems just to be hinted that Hercules was not very fond
of the cicadas’ song, and Virgil—but he was a Roman—has
called it (<i><span lang="la">infandum!</span></i>) a <i>creaking</i> note. On the whole,
however, when he mentions these insects, he gives us a
pleasing picture.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c018'>

</div>

<p class='c015'>he sings; a line which seems bathed in sunlight, and makes
one see the green lizards too. On the whole I cannot help
thinking that Virgil loved the cicadas.</p>

<p class='c017'>It is interesting to find that in modern Italy, generally,
but especially in Tuscany, the old ideas and legends in
regard to the cicadas have not yet died out. Still, according
to the Tuscan peasant, they were maids—not men—before
the Muses, till Apollo, as a mark of his favour,
promoted them into insects. Now, however, but little
distinction seems to be drawn between cicadas and crickets,
or grasshoppers, and, indeed, this was to some extent the
case in classical times—the three often figuring together on
ancient coins or rings. Amongst all of these—and together
they supply a number of species—the greatest
favourite with the Tuscan peasant of to-day—as perhaps
<a id='Page_106'></a>it was in days long gone by—is a beautiful grey-green
grasshopper, which the Americans would call a Katydid,
but is, here, the cavalletta. This insect is looked
upon as the special patron of children, upon whom it has
the power of conferring musical and poetic genius, as well
as more general mental endowments. To perform this
properly, however, it must enter the room where its little
favourite lies asleep, and this it seems often to do. The
mother, should she see it, has her own part to play in the
matter, which she does by tying the beneficent insect,
by a long thread, to the bed-post, and chanting the
following verses, with the idea, probably, that “then the
charm is firm and good.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Cicadas in England—A blower of bubbles—The prolific Aphis—A nice
calculation—Scientific curiosity—Dragon-fly armies—The son of
the south-west wind.</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_0_4 c015'>IT is generally understood that there are no cicadas
or tettixes in England, and this—with a reservation
in favour of a single species residing in the New
Forest—is roundly asserted in various entomological
works of authority. Since, however, Mr. George Bowdler
Buckton, <span class='fss'>F.R.S.</span>, has written a monograph of the British
<i><span lang="la">Cicadæ</span></i>, or <i><span lang="la">Tettigidæ</span></i>, in two volumes, each of which has
a number of plates giving figures of the various species,
all with their Latin names, there would seem to be
a conflict of learned opinion; and I, for my part—since
one of these species has relations with a nice little parasite
which I should like to describe—am of opinion, after profound
investigation and impartial weighing of the evidence
on both sides, that Mr. Buckton is right. What strikes
one at first sight as curious is that numbers of creatures,
as large sometimes as humble bees, or larger, and of very
striking appearance—often quite brilliantly coloured—should
for so long have escaped observation; for certainly
one has never seen them oneself, and, on making inquiries,
one soon finds that nobody else has. But there is an
explanation of this seeming miracle, and that of a not
<a id='Page_109'></a>very satisfactory nature. One may have noticed, whilst
going through the plates, that in the neighbourhood
of each striking figure there are two little irrelevant-looking
black lines, drawn soft and fine, very unobtrusive,
looking as though they wished to elude observation;
and gradually it begins to dawn upon you that
these lines represent the real size in linear measurement
of the very salient, <i><span lang="fr">outré</span></i>-looking creature you
are looking at. This, then, is the key to the mystery.
England is full of cicadas, but they are all so small that
nobody can see them—at least without taking some
trouble. So our poets have been silent, our philosophers
have made no reflections, and our ploughmen, to this day,
are without a proper objective for those appreciative perceptions
of life around them which, if it only existed,
there might be some evidence of their possessing.
Our aristocracy too, or old county families, have never
been able to “think gold of themselves,” as the saying is,
on account of their golden tettix-pins, though the feeling
itself has not been entirely denied them. In a word, our
national character has been uninfluenced by cicadas, and,
on this, two questions arise: first—for it is no use to
start on an assumption—whether faults exist in it, and
then, if they do, whether all or any of them are due to
this cause. But such matters are for the historian to deal
with, and would be out of place in the pages of a work
like this.</p>

<p class='c017'>Though cicadas are so small in England—whilst their
voices, if they have any, as there seems no particular reason
to doubt, are too attenuated to be audible to our human
<a id='Page_110'></a>ears—yet they are not quite invisible. When seen, however,
they are known by some other name, such as frog-hoppers,
tree-hoppers, or the like. Some of these, in their larval
stage, which much resembles the adult, take a great deal
of pains to conceal themselves, though in this they have
another reason than that of wishing to elude observation.
Our common cuckoo-spit is a good instance of this, and
also of how a wrong explanation of a common and easily
observed phenomenon may for a long time be given, not
only in popular works, but also in scientific text-books
or monographs, or within the supposedly up-to-date pages
of various encyclopædias. The cuckoo-spit, as everyone
knows, sits in the midst of a little bower of froth (allied
to that other of bliss perhaps) which, on being examined,
resolves itself into an accumulation of bubbles, having
a somewhat sticky consistency. We had always been told—and
still are now very often, though the contrary has
been well made out—that these bubbles proceeded from
the insect itself, after the manner of any other secretion.
But this is not the case. The secretion here is only a clear
fluid, and into this the insect afterwards blows bubbles
by a mechanical process, and through the addition of air.
It is Professor E. S. Morse who, in the pages of <i>Appleton’s
Popular Scientific Monthly</i>,<a id='r35'></a><a href='#f35' class='c016'><sup>[35]</sup></a> has thus revolutionised all
our ideas on this subject. His account is as follows:
“The so-called frog-spittle or cuckoo-spit appears as little
flecks of froth on grass, buttercups, and many other
plants during the early summer. Immersed in this froth
is found a little green insect, sometimes two or three
<a id='Page_111'></a>of them concealed by the same moist covering. This little
creature represents the early stage of an insect which, in
its full growth, still lives upon grass, and is easily recognised
by its triangular shape and its ability of jumping
like a grasshopper.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“If the insect is cleared from the mass of froth it will
crawl quite rapidly along the stem of the plant, stopping,
at times, to pierce the stem for the purpose of sucking the
juices within, and finally settling down in earnest, clutching
the stem with its legs. After sucking for some time, a
clear fluid is seen to exude from the end of the abdomen,
flowing over the body first, and gradually filling up the
spaces between the legs and the lower part of the body and
the stem upon which it rests. During all this time not a
trace of an air-bubble appears; simply a clear, slightly viscid
fluid is exuded, and this is the only matter that escapes
from the insect. This state of partial immersion continues
for an hour or more. During this time, and even when
walking, the posterior segments of the insect’s abdomen
are extended at intervals, the abdomen turning upwards
at the same time. It is a kind of reaching-up movement,
but whether this action accompanies a discharge of fluid,
or is an attempt at reaching for air, I have not ascertained.
Suddenly the insect begins to make bubbles by turning
its tail out of the fluid, opening the posterior segment, and
grasping, as with a pair of claspers, a moiety of air, then
turning the tail down into the fluid, again, and instantly
allowing the enclosed air to escape. These movements
go on at the rate of seventy or eighty times a minute.
The tail is moved alternately to the right and left in
<a id='Page_112'></a>perfect rhythm, so that the bubbles are distributed on
both sides of the body, and these are crowded towards
the head, till the entire fluid is filled with bubbles, and
the froth thus made runs over the back and around the
stem. In half a minute some thirty or forty bubbles are
made in this way—a bulk of air two or three times
exceeding that of the body—without the slightest
diminution in the size of the body.”</p>

<p class='c017'>It seems clear, therefore, that the air which is put to
this purpose is abstracted directly from the atmosphere,
and that neither it nor the bubbles manufactured through
it have ever been within the body of the insect. Moreover,
if the little bubble-maker be thoroughly dried—which,
according to Professor Morse, is a matter of
difficulty—it will continue to secrete such spare fluid as
it still has, but not the tiniest bubble is seen to issue
with this. If set in a drop of water it struggles to the
surface, and then goes through the same process of blowing
bubbles as it has done when immersed in fluid of its
own distilling. The result, however, is not the same, for
the water will not hold the bubbles, which constantly
disappear. Such, then, is the manner in which the frothy
pool is made. What purposes does it answer? That of
a pond, apparently, for it would appear that in their
larval state these little frog-, or tree-hoppers, are to some
extent aquatic insects. If kept dry and not allowed to
renew their supply of fluid, their body shrivels, and
before long they die. This is not through suffocation,
since they can breathe air, by means of spiracles, in the
ordinary way. If, however, they are examined closely,
<a id='Page_113'></a>certain leaf-like appendages may be detected upon each
side of the seventh and eighth segments of the abdomen,
and Professor Morse suggests that these may be of the
nature of branchiæ, or gills, enabling the insect to
breathe, also, in water or fluid, by abstracting the air
from it, after the manner of a fish, as some other aquatic
larvæ do. “As many of these,” he says, “respire in two
ways, either inhaling air through the spiracles, or by
means of branchial leaflets, so <i><span lang="la">Aphrophora</span></i> (for that is
the classic name of our insect) may likewise utilise its
branchial tufts for the same purpose. Thus we may see
the reason for this bubble-blowing, since each fresh
bubble added to the mass may aerate the fluid, so to
speak, and thus secure at intervals a fresh supply of
oxygen.”<a id='r36'></a><a href='#f36' class='c016'><sup>[36]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c017'>In early spring, if one examines the leaf-buds of rose
trees, which now begin to swell, one may often see tiny
little black specks, like grains of gunpowder, scattered
over their surface, especially within any fold or crevice
which it presents. These are the eggs of the Aphides,
insects which, if not cicadas, are not so very far removed
from them, and which, looked at from various points of
view, are extremely interesting little creatures. One of
these points of view, which we may conveniently start
from, is their extraordinary rate of increase, which
exceeds even that of the Chinese. “A single insect,”
says Mr. Buckton, “hatched from one of these shining
black ova may be the mother of many billions of young,
even during her lifetime. Réaumur calculated that one
Aphis may be the mother of the enormous number of
<a id='Page_114'></a>5,904,900,000 individuals during the month or six weeks
of her existence. But neither Tongard nor Morren is
satisfied with this estimate, both declaring that quintillions
are within the capabilities of a single mother’s
efforts. Professor Huxley (who, by the way, was not
interested in the alleged phenomena of spiritualism, <i>even
if true</i>) makes a curious calculation which, at any rate,
affords some approximate idea of what a quintillion of
Aphides might mean. Assuming that an Aphis weighs
as little as one-thousandth of a grain (which is less than
I should ever have thought), and that it requires a man
to be very stout to weigh more than two million grains,
he shows that the tenth brood of Aphides alone, without
adding the product of all the generations which precede
the tenth, if all the members survive the perils to which
they are exposed, contains more ponderable substance
than 500,000,000 of stout men: that is, more than the
whole population of China.”<a id='r37'></a><a href='#f37' class='c016'><sup>[37]</sup></a> This, it appears, is an
under-estimate, which is rather annoying, for one would
like to call it a gross exaggeration. But facts are facts—in
whatever degree they may interest one—and it is
impossible not to feel respect for an insect like this,
especially in these days, when the diminished returns of
the census are beginning to cause alarm as to the future
destinies even of our own once proudly fecund race. It
is a wonderful record for a single individual—to have
weighed down China—and when Mr. Buckton remarks
that facts like these regarding the prolific nature of
Aphides “afford sufficient explanation of the occurrence
of the extraordinary swarms so often noticed by authors,”<a href='#f37' class='c016'><sup>[37]</sup></a>
<a id='Page_115'></a>nobody is likely to disagree with him. With billions a
certainty, and quintillions in the air, swarms seem amply
accounted for.</p>

<p class='c017'>One of the authors here alluded to is our homely
immortal, White of Selborne. “I shall here mention,”
he says, “an emigration of small Aphides, which was
observed in the village of Selborne no longer ago than
August 1st, 1785. At about three o’clock in the afternoon
of that day, which was very hot, the people of this
village were surprised by a shower of Aphides, or smother-flies,
which fell in these parts. Those that were walking
in the streets at that juncture found themselves covered
with these insects, which settled, also, on the hedges
and gardens, blackening all the vegetables where they
alighted. My annuals were discoloured with them, and
the stalks of a bed of onions were quite coated over for
six days after. These armies were then, no doubt, in a
state of emigration and shifting their quarters; and might
have come, as far as we know, from the great hop-plantations
of Kent or Sussex, the wind being, all that day, in
the easterly quarter. They were observed, at the same
time, in great clouds about Farnham, and all along the
vale from Farnham to Alton.”<a id='r38'></a><a href='#f38' class='c016'><sup>[38]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c017'>Other great migrations of Aphides have at various
times been observed. In the autumn of 1834 the city of
Gand was invaded, and, one may almost say, taken by
a vast army of them, and at Bruges and Antwerp the
same swarm is said to have darkened the sun,<a id='r39'></a><a href='#f39' class='c016'><sup>[39]</sup></a> a result of
such gatherings more noticeable elsewhere than in England,
since our sun usually is darkened. Insects, though
<a id='Page_116'></a>their movements are not so regular, nor, as a rule, so
noticeable as those of birds, yet often migrate—how often
or how regularly it is difficult to say. Locusts are, of
course, the stock example as well as the most terrific one,
but perhaps dragon-flies, were they as destructive, would
have been as much noted in this connexion. Their migrations
seem to be tolerably frequent, and a record of them
between 1494 and 1868 has been published by Koppen, a
German entomologist. In 1881 a great flight of them
took place in Illinois. “The air,” we are told, “for
miles around seemed literally alive with these dragon-flies,
from a foot above ground to as far as eye could reach,
all flying in the same direction, a south-westerly course,
and the few that would occasionally cross the track of the
majority could all the more easily be noticed from the
very regular and swift course they generally pursued; but
even these few stray ones would soon fall in with the rest
again. Very few were seen alighting and all carefully
avoided any movable obstacles.”<a id='r40'></a><a href='#f40' class='c016'><sup>[40]</sup></a> This migration took
place during a very dry season, and may have been caused
by it owing to the drying up of swamps, ponds, etc.,
in which the insects would otherwise have laid their eggs,
obliging them to seek other suitable places.</p>

<p class='c017'>In the spring of 1900 a great migration of dragon-flies
was observed in Belgium. “All the observers agree that
the insects flew rather low, with astonishing regularity,
and without resting; that they kept close to the earth,
where there were no obstacles, but that they mounted to
a height of 10 to 12 mètres when houses or trees were
in the way. They did not go round obstacles in their line
<a id='Page_117'></a>of route, but surmounted them, and descended on the
other side. According to some observers, their flight was
very slow, others again asserting that it was very swift.
When the velocity could be estimated, however, it was
found to be at 5 mètres per second or 18 kilometres (11¼
miles) per hour (so that the slows have it). In general they
went in groups, more or less isolated, and more or less
dense.” The writer of the above account—a Belgian—concludes
thus: “All the facts point to the following conclusions:
The dragon-flies of the 5th came from regions
situated to the east of the country, which they entered in
several columns, flying at a great altitude: between 7 and
8 a.m. they descended towards the earth, continuing their
route towards the west. But we remain in ignorance of
their point of departure. The swarm probably quitted its
usual habitation early in the morning, and immediately
flew to a great height. It was only on arriving near the
earth that they flew against the wind”<a id='r41'></a><a href='#f41' class='c016'><sup>[41]</sup></a> (which, however,
they then continued to do).</p>

<p class='c017'>What Mr. Hudson calls “dragon-fly storms” are a
special phenomenon of the Pampas. In this case the
cause of the migration—for such movements seem to come
under this heading—is a special wind called the <i>pampero</i>,
that blows south-west from the interior of the Pampas.
It is very violent, cold, and dry, and the dragon-flies
evidently fear it. The “storm” is thus described by Mr.
Hudson: “It is in summer and autumn that the large
dragon-flies appear; not <i>with</i> the wind, but—and this is
the most curious part of the matter—in advance of it;
and inasmuch as these insects are not seen in the country
<a id='Page_118'></a>at other times, and frequently appear in seasons of prolonged
drought, when all the marshes and watercourses
for many hundreds of miles are dry, they must, of course,
traverse immense distances, flying before the wind at a
speed of 70 or 80 miles an hour. On some occasions
they appear almost simultaneously with the wind, going
by like a flash, and instantly disappearing from sight.
You have scarcely time to see them before the wind
strikes you. As a rule, however, they make their appearance
from 5 to 15 minutes before the wind strikes; and
when they are in great numbers, the air, to a height of
10 or 12 feet above the surface of the ground, is all at
once seen to be full of them, rushing past with extraordinary
velocity in a north-easterly direction. In very
oppressive weather, and when the swiftly advancing <i>pampero</i>
brings no moving mountains of mingled cloud and
dust, and is, consequently, not expected, the sudden
apparition of the dragon-fly is a most welcome one, for
then an immediate burst of cold wind is confidently
looked for. In the expressive vernacular of the gauchos
the large dragon-fly is called ‘<i><span lang="es">hijo del pampero</span></i>,’ son of the
south-west wind.”<a id='r42'></a><a href='#f42' class='c016'><sup>[42]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c014'>Aphides and their enemies—Curious interrelations—The biter bit—Altruistic
development—Bread and beer protectors—Saved by
ladybirds.</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_0_4 c015'>WITH prolific powers which have been successful
in arousing the interest even of the late
Professor Huxley, it is a comfort to think that
the numbers of the Aphides are always being kept down
by the operation of certain well-contrived causes, most of
which take the shape of various insect enemies. Were
all of these, or perhaps were any one of them, entirely
removed, the whole world apparently might find itself
deep buried beneath a “star-y-pointing pyramid” of insect
organisms, for what cannot quintillions, in the hands of a
competent mathematician, achieve? The wonder certainly
seems that any kind of check should be sufficient. We
owe our safety, in part, as might have been surmised, to a
small Ichneumon Fly, the traces of whose work may
generally be seen in a number of brown lifeless corpses,
which are dotted about like so many skeletons at the
feast, amongst any collection of living Aphides. These,
if examined more closely, are seen to be mere empty sacs,
each one having at some part of it a quite circular aperture,
through which the issuing guest has escaped. But
the amount of the good thus effected is not to be
<a id='Page_120'></a>estimated by the number of these shells, these nests from
which the bird has flown. Such are only in the last stage of
things, whilst almost all, including the healthiest-looking
of the living Aphides, are probably travelling along the
same road, to arrive at the same goal. All, or almost all,
have within them a guest whose energies are unceasingly
devoted to absorbing the whole of their interior arrangements
into itself, and gradually taking their place. “In
June,” says Mr. Buckton, “during the hot weather, I
have seen, at the same time, as many as three of these
flies on one rose sprig, each poised on the back of an
Aphis, which throws itself into many contortions for the
purpose of throwing off its enemy. The Ichneumon,
however, remains fixed on the back for ten or more
minutes (as though enjoying the situation) before the
ovipositor is thrust under the skin of the victim and the
egg is laid. The Aphis appears to suffer at first but
little, since it soon resumes its occupation of pumping up
the sap. A worm-like, or more commonly, a maggot-like
creature, according to the species of the parasite, hatches
from this egg, which revels in the organised nutritious
fluid elaborated by the Aphis. The greater part of the
abdomen is occupied by this maggot when it becomes full
fed, and then it may often be seen through the transparent
integument, as a grub curled into a semicircle.
Finally, the Aphis dies, the grub ceases to feed, and after a
certain period of rest cuts out of the roof of its prison
a circular plate, like a trap-door, as regular in form as if
a carpenter’s centre-bit had been used. The emerging fly
has four wings, long antennæ composed of numerous
<a id='Page_121'></a>joints, a wasp-like body and legs, and is in every way
suited for its marauding expeditions.”<a id='r43'></a><a href='#f43' class='c016'><sup>[43]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c017'>Other and more interesting dramas can take place
within the body of an Aphis; wheels within wheels, one
masterpiece of economic contrivance enclosing another,
perfection more perfected. Along what path, indeed, can
the beauty and wisdom of Nature—those endless steps
from endless seeming halting-places that become, when
reached, but so many points of fresh departure—be run
to earth, so to speak? The brain becomes, at last, almost
weary in the pursuit of wisdom’s ways, and even the
delighted spirit would fain cry, “Hold! Enough!”
Thoughts like these are powerfully excited by the following
picture.</p>

<p class='c017'>It is spring, early spring, and already the young
Aphides have begun, with gladness born of the opening
year, to absorb the sweet sap from the stems of the
immature wheat-crop. Later, however, when July’s sun
shines brightly behind its cooling screen of clouds—for in
England all climatic extremes are tempered—they ascend
in “numbers numberless” to attack the ear itself. What,
then, can save the hope of the husbandman? What
but <i><span lang="la">Ephedrus plagiator</span></i>, a small black-winged Ichneumon
Fly that even now is at work? As each individual
Aphis clings to the wheat, it becomes, in spite of its
efforts to fill itself, hollower and hollower; its appetite
flags, and ere it can fatally affect the plant on which
man’s life and the machinations of the protectionist
depend, it has become a mere brown pupa-case for a body
other than its own to develop in. A day or two, and
<a id='Page_122'></a>almost on every grain of the wheat hangs an insect,
lifeless, but—oh, floweret springing from the tomb!—life-filled.
Hardly a living Aphis is to be seen feeding
amongst them. The wheat-crop has been saved. But
the march of events, thus unfolded, does not end here.
Another drama has to be played out ere the full life
issues from the once living cradle whose contents it has
absorbed and become, nor will it bear the image of that
particular Ichneumon Fly that laid its little egg, some
weeks ago, in the body that seemed so designed for it.
Like the Aphis, the Ichneumon, too, must learn to live
for others, thus rising through selfishness to a purer and
higher embodiment. If we pass a little later through the
same cornfield, another insect, differing from, yet of the
same general type as the prior parasite, may be seen
running to and fro over the wheat-ears, tapping each
tenanted abode with tremulously quivering antennæ,
which, as well as the whole body, seem to vibrate
with excitement. It is looking for lodgings, but not
every house so touched can be utilised, for <i><span lang="la">Ceraphrus Carpenteri</span></i>—such
is the new tenant’s name—must first be
satisfied that none of its own species have already taken
possession. Once assured on this point, however, its duty
lies plain before it, and bending its antennæ against the
wheat-ear, so as to form a fulcrum, it turns the tip of its
abdomen towards that of the dead Aphis, and with
its ovipositor commences to saw through the skin. As
much as ten minutes may be occupied in the accomplishment
of this task, for the sarcophagus that has thus to be
pierced is hard, and the ovipositor, though short, is not
<a id='Page_123'></a>stout, but slenderly formed. But there is no flagging of
energy, and at length, when efforts steadily continued have
been crowned with success, the same deft instrument
is again employed to pierce the sleeping <i><span lang="la">ephedrus</span></i>, and a
second egg is deposited in this second cradle. To this
new tenant the former one must now yield up the juices
of its body, even as those of the Aphis were freely
rendered unto it. It must die in its turn, but by its
death another lives, and thus the physical act of aggression,
which we call selfishness, becomes the seed-bed, as it
were, or forcing-house—the food-plant, to use an entomological
simile—of a moral altruism. True, the Aphis
may at first struggle, the maggot, pierced by the ovipositor,
may flinch for a moment, but after that there is
complete passivity, without which there can be no complete
acquiescence. Self-absorption, that is the moral of
it all; for the true self of the Aphis, which is not represented
by the outer husk, is absorbed into the Ichneumon,
and so in regard to the latter. Thus, throughout the
animal kingdom we must look to the inner, and not to
the outer, significance. What matters it, though Nature
be “red in tooth and claw,” if the fierce rendings of the
outer integuments are but as the first gropings towards
interior rest and calm? And should we not, in the lower
walks of life, look to the soul through the body, and see
in processes which, with ourselves, might seem to represent
the flesh only, a blending which but anticipates the more
complete separation? Thus, and thus only, as it appears
to me, can we impart beauty to a scheme which, without
this key, must appear selfish and unsatisfactory. The key
<a id='Page_124'></a>may be hard to find, but when we once hold it we need
no longer repine.</p>

<p class='c017'>Besides the Wheat Aphis, which but for such arrangements
as have here been glanced at, would almost deprive
us of bread, we have the Hop Aphis, a species the dread of
which is still more strongly disseminated amongst the
masses of this country, inasmuch as its interference would
be with the supply of beer. No wonder, then, that the
little ladybird is beloved by all, since, but for its efforts,
many a poor man might have to live in a state of enforced
sobriety, which, in its turn, must deleteriously
affect that position of respect and esteem which many
illustrious and highly placed individuals now hold in the
hearts of the people, so that a general disturbal of habits
and ideas, amounting almost to moral chaos, would attend
any serious diminution in the numbers of this insect,
England’s true guardian angel. But it were unjust to
claim an undue share in the merit of recognising work
like this. Appreciation of such services is, as one might
expect, widely spread, and is expressed in such popular
names as, for instance, in Lombardy “Bestioline del
Signore,” in Tuscany “Madonnine” or “Marioline,” in
France “Bête” or “Vache à Dieu,” and in Germany
“Sonnenkäfer.” The first-named countries, indeed, are
not, or used not to be, beer-drinking, so that unless this
little madonna is a patroness of the vine too, they are not
so easy to understand. It may, however, be incidentally
mentioned that the ladybirds are good friends to the
orchards, and destroy many thousands of apple- or plum-eating
Aphides.</p>

<p class='c017'><a id='Page_125'></a>Aphides, in fact, of some kind or other, are what they
have come into the world to destroy. It is their mission,
their epos.</p>

<p class='c017'>The following account of the habits of these beneficent
creatures, principally in the above connection, is
given by Mr. Buckton, a profound student of insect life-histories:
“The food of Coccinella (the ladybird) consists
almost exclusively of Aphides. Their marvellous
voracity is shown equally in their larval and their winged
condition. The former stage may be commonly seen
throughout early summer as slaty-grey or brown six-footed
creatures, covered with tufted tubercles, and provided
with mandibles efficient both for holding and
sucking out the juices of their victims. In some years
the imagos (or grown insects) are wonderfully numerous,
and when they take wing form vast swarms which travel
great distances. In the year 1869 such a cloud passed
over a large part of Kent, Sussex, and Surrey,” and their
effect (of the same genial nature as that of Bacchus
wandering through the earth) was soon seen in the good
hop crop of the following year. “Although the Coccinella
is not restricted to the Hop Aphis for its food, it frequently
follows its migrations, and travels on the same
winds. Whilst feeding, the Aphis is held and manipulated
by the jaws or palpi of the Coccinella, and the
devouring operation proceeds amidst the struggles of the
victims from the apex of the abdomen to the thorax,
which parts, together with the head and legs, are finally
rejected.”<a href='#f43' class='c016'><sup>[43]</sup></a> This process—which is by no means confined
to insect life, but extends upwards from it even into the
<a id='Page_126'></a>highly organised mammalia—does not seem to be a
pleasant one to witness, for Mr. Buckton remarks upon it:
“We may express some hope, in sympathy with the
Aphis, that the automatic theory of animal life may here
find some place, and that reflex action may explain the
fact that, under the microscope, the mutilated remains of
the Aphis, without stomach and without internal organs,
have been seen to walk away and live after the operation
for a considerable time! Automatically the Coccinella
furbishes up its jaws and antennæ in readiness for another
meal. From thirty to forty Aphides may thus be consumed
in one hour.”<a href='#f43' class='c016'><sup>[43]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c017'>Automatically perhaps—that is to say, between the
lines—we may gather Mr. Buckton’s opinion of the automatic
theory. There are some theories which seem held,
like dykes or barriers, to prevent the sea from getting in.
One doesn’t want the sea to get in, because it would
swamp such a lot of things, which, although quite
artificial, one is not prepared to part with, but one doesn’t
believe in the barrier except for that particular purpose
to which it is applied. The automatic theory in
regard to animals is a case in point. Scientific men make
use of it in order to keep out another, which they don’t
want to have to admit, though they do, as a fact, believe
in it. This, again, one can read between the lines whenever
they give any account of their observations on this or
that animal, whether it be dog or elephant, ants or something
much lower down in the scale—rotifers, for instance,
or amœba in the ocean of a watch-glass. One sees what
they really mean very well then, though they may not
<a id='Page_127'></a>themselves be aware of it, but they are never in the least
<i>convincing</i> when they air their automatic theory.
Aphides, as may have been gathered incidentally, feed
wholly upon the juices or sap of plants. Active <i><span lang="la">ab ovo</span></i>
(which means from the egg), “their occupation,” says Mr.
Buckton, “is to grow as fast as possible,” and with a view
to this end the rostrum or beak, with its enclosed sucking
or pumping apparatus, is fully developed from the very
commencement, “often, indeed, to such an abnormal
extent that it forms an awkward appendage, trailing
behind the body whilst walking.”<a href='#f43' class='c016'><sup>[43]</sup></a> The insect does not,
however, walk much, but, settling itself down on the twig
or stem where, perhaps, it first saw the light, pierces the
bark with the instrument thus provided for it, and commences
to suck up the sap into its mouth. This is not a
process which can be indulged in with impunity to the
plant, especially since Aphides reside in great societies
upon the same one, and turn their attention to every part
of it, not even excepting the roots. Troops of small
Aphides, in fact, have sometimes been found in the pips of
large codling apples. In consequence of this excessive
drain upon their fluids, which is as though our own blood
were to be sucked, plants thus invaded by Aphides become
greatly weakened, and their young shoots and leaves have
a distorted appearance in consequence. Others, either
through this cause alone, or in consequence of some
poison or acid injected by the Aphis, have gall-like
excresences produced upon them. These have a hollow
interior, into which the Aphides penetrate, and there
take up their residence. Such swellings thus become
their houses, and therefore, since it is a great advantage to
the Aphides to be sheltered in this way, it is possible that
<a id='Page_128'></a>some special instinct through the exercise of which the tree
is thus affected, may have been implanted in them by the
action of natural selection.</p>

<p class='c017'>Aphides are often spoken of by entomologists as if a
very high degree of interest attached to them, and, no
doubt, in many respects this is the case. As we have seen,
they exhibit certain phenomena of <i>corporealism</i> (which
<i>did</i> interest Professor Huxley) to a greater extent perhaps
than any other creature, though of this I am not at all
sure; but after all one soon gets over the wonder of that,
especially since there is no realising it, and then it does
not seem to raise a creature to a very high level of interest.
Again, to quote authority, “there is a most curious alternation
of broods in these insects, some forms being winged
and with separate sexes, and others wingless or apterous
and capable of producing their kind for an indefinite
number of generations before a sexual brood is again
developed. In fact, the anomalies of members of this
family are endless, and it would require volumes to
epitomise even the comparatively little which has already
been discovered with reference to their habits and transformations.”<a id='r44'></a><a href='#f44' class='c016'><sup>[44]</sup></a>
Still, for all this, it is difficult to look long
at an Aphis, or a collection of Aphides upon a rose tree or
any other of the plants they affect, without getting
heartily tired of them, and for me, as perhaps for most
people, the principal interest about these sluggish
creatures lies in the relations which have become established,
without any intelligent efforts on their own part,
between them and ants—but it will be best to reserve
the discussion of this subject for the following chapter.</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_0_4 c015'>A drop of honey, or something like it, is the connecting
bond between the ant and the Aphis. It is
exuded by the latter through certain tubercles
which are situated at the end of the abdomen, and is, of
course, the product of the endless quantities of sap,
which, so long as it lasts, these insects are for ever pumping
up from the plant they inhabit, and swallowing. This
honey, or honey-dew, to use the more special name
bestowed on it, the ants want, but they are not content
with drinking it whenever it issues from its manufacturers,
in natural course. This is not sufficient, and they have
learned to increase the flow of so valued a beverage by
their own efforts—in other words, they milk the Aphides,
which thus become their cows. To do this they tap
them with their antennæ, softly and gently, on the sides
of the abdomen—a quick little shower of touches. Under
the influence of this probably pleasant sensation the
Aphis becomes willing to part, and, raising the abdomen,
“teems her refreshing dew” in a drop from the tip of it.
This action of the ants cannot, in Europe, be successfully
<a id='Page_130'></a>imitated, at least it has not been, and if an ant is not
forthcoming the fluid is contained in the body of the
Aphis until necessity compels its being ejected. Probably
the ants, if delayed in their visits, are missed by the
Aphides, as a cow misses her milker, and long before they
do excrete, as the process is called, they would perhaps
have done so had they felt able. The sensation no
doubt of the ant’s antennæ on the abdomen has become,
through usage, the almost necessary stimulus to the act
produced by it.</p>

<p class='c017'>The above remarks are best illustrated by a quotation
from Darwin, which, in my opinion, should always be
given in any general account of the relations of ants
and Aphides. “I removed,” says Darwin, “all the ants
from a group of about a dozen Aphides on a dock plant,
and prevented their attendance during several hours. After
this interval I felt sure that the Aphides would want to
excrete. I watched them for some time through a lens,
but not one excreted. I then tickled and stroked them
with a hair in the same manner, as well as I could, as the
ants do with their antennæ; but not one excreted.
Afterwards I allowed an ant to visit them, and it immediately
seemed, by its eager way of running about, to be
well aware what a rich flock it had discovered; it then
began to play with its antennæ on the abdomen first of
one Aphis and then of another; and each, as soon as it
felt the antennæ, lifted up its abdomen and excreted a
limpid drop of sweet juice, which was eagerly devoured
by the ant. Even the quite young Aphides behaved in
this manner, showing that the action was instinctive, and
<a id='Page_131'></a>not the result of experience. It is certain, from the
observations of Huber, that the Aphides show no dislike
to the ants: if the latter be not present, they are at last
compelled to eject their excretion. But, as the excretion
is extremely viscid it is no doubt a convenience to the
Aphides to have it removed; therefore, probably, they do
not excrete solely for the good of the ants.”<a id='r45'></a><a href='#f45' class='c016'><sup>[45]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c017'>If the reverse of this were the case, if the Aphides did
excrete for the sole benefit of the ants, then, in Darwin’s
own opinion, the case for natural selection would be
broken down, and with this there would be some better
ground of reason for those who would see in relations of
this sort a set-off, as it were, against the never-ending
bloodshed and rapine, accompanied with suffering in varied—often
in an intense—degree, which is the very stuff out
of which Nature has woven her mantle. But there can be
no essential difference where the principle at work is precisely
the same. So long as a creature does benefit itself,
the way in which it does it, and the incidental effects of
its doing so, are of no consequence; it is the motive power
that the philosopher has to consider, and there is little
comfort—if comfort be needed—in knowing that an animal,
to do itself good, is doing good to some other, when one
also knows that, governed by the same incentive, it would
as cheerfully prey upon that other’s eye. As Hamlet
says, in such a case “the readiness is all.”</p>

<p class='c017'>As an illustration of this truth here is another picture
of how ants procure honey from a weaker creature that
may happen to have swallowed it, when it is not to be
obtained by the soft methods of persuasion. “Once upon
<a id='Page_132'></a>a time,” says Dr. Lincecum, “there dwelt in my yard a
flourishing colony of the very smallest species of black
ant,” and having described how these Lilliputians found
and ate some syrup belonging to the household, and were
in consequence attacked by a larger and stronger species,
he continues, “They”—that is the attacking party—“grabbed
up the heavily burdened little fellows, doubled
them, and biting open the abdomen, drew out the full sac,
and seemed to swallow it. Then, casting the lacerated
carcase aside, they furiously sprung upon another of the
panic-stricken crowd and repeated the horrid operation.”<a id='r46'></a><a href='#f46' class='c016'><sup>[46]</sup></a>
Clearly, then, Nature, so long as she can attain her end,
cares not by what means she attains it.</p>

<p class='c017'>Independently of any feeling of comfort which the
Aphides may experience in being milked by the ants,
observation at once shows that they benefit largely, in
a general way, by the attentions of the latter. It is not
enough for the ants to milk their cows when they happen
to meet them. They go very much farther than this, and
cow-keeping is of as much importance with them as with
us. Lucky the Aphis who has a guard of ants round it,
fiery warriors prepared to defend their property against
all foes. None need be feared now. Let but an Ichneumon
buzz, and a dozen stalwarts start to the rescue.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c018'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“I dare thee but to breathe upon my love.”</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>

      <div class='line in1'>I’ll buckler thee against a million.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c015'>And so they do indeed, or against any reasonable number.
But there is no combination amongst these banditti.
Each comes but to eat his own Aphis, and no one thinks
<a id='Page_133'></a>of helping a friend. All therefore are powerless before
the organised attack of so fierce a bodyguard. Whilst
the ants are with them the Aphides are quite safe, and
they are often permanently guarded in this way. Other
ants take even more elaborate precautions for the safety
of their property, placing them in stalls, where they stand,
by plastering earth, etc., about the plant on which they
are feeding. Lastly, others still conduct them into their
own nest, where they keep them, sometimes, in a chamber
specially prepared for their reception, every necessary
measure being taken for their proper nourishment, and, as
one may say, comfort. Nay, the very eggs of the Aphides
are tended by the ants, and hatch out in their own
nurseries. Nor is it little for which they do all this, since,
taking their size into consideration, the yield of these ant-cows
each day must be much greater than that of our own—at
least, I should imagine so.</p>

<p class='c017'>It is not all ants who do these things, nor do any do all
of them, but where there are Aphides and also ants, it
would seem to be the exception rather than the rule for
the latter to neglect them.</p>

<p class='c017'>But Aphides, though the principal ant-cows of Europe,
are not the only ones even there, whilst elsewhere various
other species that have this honey-excreting property
become their substitutes. “In the tropics,” says Belt, in
his much-observing work, “their place is taken in a great
measure by species of <i><span lang="la">coccidæ</span></i> and genera of <i><span lang="la">Homoptera</span></i>,
such as <i><span lang="la">Membracis</span></i> and its allies. My pineapples were
greatly subject to the attacks of a small, soft-bodied,
brown coccus, that was always guarded by a little black
<a id='Page_134'></a>stinging ant (<i><span lang="la">Solenopsis</span></i>). This ant took great care of the
scale-insects, and attacked savagely any one interfering
with them, as I often found to my cost when trying to
clear my pines by being stung severely by them. Not
content with watching over their cattle, the ants brought
up grains of damp earth, and built domed galleries over
them, in which, under the vigilant guard of their savage
little attendants, the scale insects must, I think, have been
secure from the attacks of all enemies.”<a id='r47'></a><a href='#f47' class='c016'><sup>[47]</sup></a> And again, the
same naturalist tells us, “The pawpaw trees growing in
my garden were infested by a small brown species of
<i><span lang="la">Membracis</span></i>—one of the leaf-hoppers that laid its eggs in a
cottony nest on the under part of the leaves. The hopper
would stand covering the nest until the young were
hatched. These were little soft-bodied, dark-coloured
insects, looking like Aphides, but more robust, and with
the hind segments turned up. From the end of these the
little larvæ exuded drops of honey, and were assiduously
attended by small ants belonging to two species of the
genus <i><span lang="la">Pheidole</span></i>. A third ant—a species of <i><span lang="la">Hypoclinea</span></i>—which
I have mentioned before as a cowardly species,
whenever it found any young hoppers unattended, would
relieve them of their honey, but would scamper away on
the approach of any of the <i><span lang="la">Pheidole</span></i>. The latter do not
sting, but they attack and bite the hand if the young
hoppers are interfered with.”<a href='#f47' class='c016'><sup>[47]</sup></a> The latter “are, when young,
so soft-bodied and sluggish in their movements, and there
are so many enemies ready to prey upon them, that I
imagine that in the tropics many species would be exterminated
if it were not for the protection of the ants.”<a href='#f47' class='c016'><sup>[47]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c017'><a id='Page_135'></a>But these leaf-hoppers had not only ants, but wasps to
protect them, and there were constant skirmishes and
bickerings on their account between the two. The wasp
obtained the honey just in the same way as the ants—namely,
by stroking the hoppers with its antennæ, and its
possession of wings, more than its greater size, gave
it a clear advantage over its rival. It did not grapple
with the latter, even when there was only a single one
to dispute its right, but, rising on the wing, and hovering
about till a good opportunity presented itself, it would
dart down suddenly on the impertinent little dwarf, and
strike it from the leaf or stem. So quick was this action
that Mr. Belt could not determine whether it was with
the feet or the mandibles that the wasp delivered its
blow, but he thinks it was with the former; that is to
say, the front pair of them. But in spite of its superiority
in single combat, the wasp could not prevail against the
numbers of the ants. If, indeed, it was first in the field,
there was not much difficulty, for though the leaf would
before long be found by some or other of the ants, yet the
first arrivals were only pioneers, and when once they were
knocked off it it had to be found again, only for a similar
fate to befall the new discoverers. Often, however, the
wasp would try to clear a leaf already in possession of
the ants, and the way to which was known. But in this
it was never successful, for though many fell, streams
of others came rushing up, so that the wasp had no
time to enjoy the fruits of its labours, but was obliged
to keep constantly fighting, and before long was tired out.
Though a giant amongst pigmies, and having wings—a
<a id='Page_136'></a>sort of flying-dragon contending with an army of knights—yet
it did not despise its small enemies, and evidently
dreaded lest any of them should succeed in fastening on it.
No doubt it knew—from inheritance, or experience, or both—that
an ant clinging to a leg was a difficult thing to
get rid of, and to avoid being placed in this position
it never fought upon the ground—that is, the leaf—but
only on the wing, in the manner described. Had it used
its mandibles to bite with, the ants would have seized
them, and some might have got on its body. Its sting
played no part, doubtless because the small size and hard
bodies of the ants would have rendered it ineffective.</p>

<p class='c017'>We see from the above account that ants are not the
only insects that can make discreet use of honey-yielding
creatures, though they excel all others in this respect.
Wasps have also learnt to milk, if not to stall, their kine,
and to wasps, it would seem, must be added—which need
not surprise us—at least one species of bee. A correspondent,
whose name and date of communication I cannot
now remember, says, writing to <i>Nature</i>: “Fritz Muller
has observed in Brazil a larva of a leaf-hopper—<i>Umbonia
indicator</i>—which is used, like the Aphides by the ants, as
milch cattle by a species of stingless bee—<i>Trigonia
Cagafogo</i>. This bee is fond of oily matters, and feeds on
carrion, old stinking cheese, and oil secreted by various
plants. Although stingless, it possesses a very intense
venom, which causes a most lively irritation of the skin.”
I wish I could give the details of a fact so interesting, but
have not had the opportunity of reading the original
account from which this bald statement is taken. The
<a id='Page_137'></a>ants, therefore, have rivals in this industry, and possibly
such rivalry may exist to an extent hitherto unsuspected.</p>

<p class='c017'>Though the protection of these insects by the ants
architecturally—by moist earth placed round them,
that is to say—is mentioned in the above account, it is
not dwelt upon, and seems to play but a small part in the
general drama. Some ants, however, rely solely on this
method. Mr. Gaudie, writing in the <i>Victorian Naturalist</i>,<a id='r48'></a><a href='#f48' class='c016'><sup>[48]</sup></a>
gives the following account of one of these: “A small
species of ant, commonly distributed in the Mallee, has a
curious habit of keeping in close confinement a rather
large mealy Aphis, which feeds on the stems of young
eucalyptus gum trees. Round and over these Aphides the
ants construct a domed covering of particles of bark,
grass, etc., which serves the double purpose of imprisoning
the aphides and excluding other ants. Some of these
coverings appear to be entirely closed, whilst others have
an opening left in the edges. This doorway is, however,
constantly guarded by a pair of ants, which continually
move about in the open space, and seem much impressed
with the importance of the duty assigned to them. Each
enclosure contains generally from three to a dozen
Aphides, and about the same number of ants. Upon
making a breach in some of these structures for the
purpose of observation, I have noticed that many of
the live stock were immediately seized by the ants and
forcibly removed to a place of safety. The ant under
notice is about a quarter of an inch in length, and is
of a uniform dark, reddish-brown colour, and forms
<a id='Page_138'></a>its ordinary habitation under logs, or in old rotten
stumps, and sometimes in the ground. Several other
species of ants are very assiduous in their attendance
on the various aphides, <i><span lang="la">tettigonidæ</span></i>, and coccids, but
the above is the only kind I have noticed that uses
such extraordinary means to secure a monopoly of the
much-prized ‘honey-dew.’”</p>

<p class='c017'>For ants that keep and rear Aphides in their nests we
need not go farther than our own little yellow one—<i>Lasius
flavus</i>. They guard and look after the eggs of
their protégés, which form little black shiny clusters,
with the same care that they bestow on their own, and
when they are hatched set about providing food for
the young aphides. This, it would appear, does not
consist of the roots of various plants penetrating the nest
itself, for Sir John Lubbock found that the first business
of the ants, after the young aphides had appeared, was
to conduct or carry them out of the nest, evidently in
order that they should find their natural food. None
being at hand under these artificial conditions, and
the plants required not being known, the poor aphides all
died, and this happened again the following year. In the
year succeeding to this, however, Sir John was more
fortunate, and this is the account he gives of his interesting
discovery: “The eggs commenced to hatch the first
week in March. Near one of my nests of <i><span lang="la">Lasius flavus</span></i>,
in which I had placed some of the eggs in question, was
a glass containing living specimens of several species
of plants commonly found on or around ants’ nests. To
this some of the aphides were brought by the ants.
<a id='Page_139'></a>Shortly afterwards I observed on a plant of daisy, in
the axils of the leaves, some small aphides very much
resembling those from my nest, though we had not
actually traced them continuously. They seemed thriving,
and remained stationary on the daisy. Moreover, whether
they had sprung from the black eggs or not, the ants
evidently valued them, for they built up a wall of earth
round and over them. So things remained throughout
the summer, but on the 9th of October I found that
the aphides had laid some eggs exactly resembling those
found in the ants’ nests; and on examining daisy-plants
from outside I found on many of them similar aphides
and more or less of the same eggs.”<a id='r49'></a><a href='#f49' class='c016'><sup>[49]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c017'>As the young aphides had been brought by the ants to
the daisies, and as they had subsequently laid their eggs
there, it would certainly seem that the ants are accustomed
to collect these eggs from without, and that the
aphides do not lay them in the nest. When they are
hatched the young aphides, as we have seen, are taken
out to feed and lay, and these new eggs laid by them
are, in their turn, brought in and tended by the ants.
This, as Sir John Lubbock remarks, is a much more
remarkable thing than if the aphides, living in the
nest with the ants, simply laid their eggs there. In
that case they would probably hatch out whether they
were tended or not, and it could not be long before the
ants would become aware of their value. Here, however,
we see this knowledge—how first obtained we know not—exhibited
in a more striking manner, and also a great
degree of foresight displayed, since as the eggs, except for
<a id='Page_140'></a>accidents, would hatch where they were, it can only be with
the idea of providing against these that the ants bring them
into their nest. There they are safe from many dangers
which threaten them above ground, and are not exposed
to the rigours of winter or other climatic vicissitudes.</p>

<p class='c017'>What are we to say of this act? I think there might
be one or two things to say, but Sir John Lubbock says
this: “Our ants may not, perhaps, lay up food for the
winter; but they do more, for they keep, during six
months, the eggs which will enable them to procure food
during the following summer—a case of prudence unexampled
in the animal kingdom.”<a href='#f49' class='c016'><sup>[49]</sup></a> There is a slight
national note here which should, perhaps, make us
suspicious. At least, I am always suspicious when a
Frenchman praises anything French, an Englishman anything
English—even ants or the climate—a Tierra del
Fuegian anything in Tierra del Fuego, and so on. No
doubt if prudence really induces the act, it is very
great, but if we could imagine any other cause through
which the habit might have begun, natural selection
would have brought about the rest, since those ants
which stored aphides’ eggs would have had more aphides,
and consequently more honey-dew to nourish them
than those which did not. Now the eggs might at first
have been eaten, and so carried down, as provisions, or
aphides, brought into the nest, might have laid before
they got out again. However the act originated, it is
probably a prudential one now, but if the growth of prudence
has been aided by that of an inherited habit, having
nothing to do with this, it is not quite so remarkable.
But what, exactly, does “our” in the above passage
<a id='Page_141'></a>mean? <i><span lang="la">Lasius flavus</span></i> is not confined to England—at least,
I suppose not—and if other countries have a claim on
its mental powers, our cue should rather be to undervalue
them—at least, the note of national vanity should be held
in check by the all as powerful one of national prejudice.</p>

<p class='c017'>Besides these particular aphides, which leave the nest
directly after leaving the egg, there are four or five other
species which live in it altogether, and feed on the roots
of various growing plants. Some nests which I had
contained a few, but under natural conditions they are
to be found, I believe, in abundance. Special chambers,
it would seem, are given up to them, and in Kirby’s
<i>Marvels of Ant Life</i> there is a picture of such a “subterranean
cow-house.” The question arises, where do
these aphides lay their eggs, and, if in the nest, does not
it largely discount the intelligence, or prudence, attributed
to <i><span lang="la">Lasius flavus</span></i> in bringing the other ones into it? In
that case, since the eggs of the various species probably
resemble one another, any found outside would be brought
in by the ants, just as their own larvæ or pupæ would be—or
anything else which they value—nor need we ascribe
greater foresight to the one act than to the other.</p>

<p class='c017'>Ants, however, do more wonderful things in relation to
aphides than this that Sir John Lubbock has recorded,
and if that act is unexampled, as an exhibition of
prudence, elsewhere in the animal kingdom, it is not,
I think, in this particular branch of it. First it must be
remarked that amongst the aphides we have what is called
the “alternation of generations,” that is to say a light-loving
generation that feeds on the stems and leaves of
<a id='Page_142'></a>upper earth, produces one that loves darkness, whose food
is only the underground roots of the plants their parents
lived on. This brood in its turn gives birth to another,
which forthwith seeks the sun, and so the round goes on.
There is this difference in the two broods, that the light-lovers,
nevertheless, seek out darkness when the time
comes to lay their eggs, whilst the children of darkness
lay theirs in the caves where they have, all their lives,
lived. That ants should be aware of all this, and
habitually adapt their cow-keeping economy to circumstances
so recondite, seems very extraordinary, but it
would certainly appear to be the case. Thus when <i>Lasius
fuliginosus</i> (another Franco-Britannico, etc., species) sees
<i><span lang="la">Schizoneura venusta</span></i>—its particular Aphis—seated on a
grass stem, and evidently wishing to lay her eggs, it
knows at once what to do. Soft and large, with voluminous
wings, such an insect is not well fitted for burrowing. She
could hardly do it, in fact, so the ants, recognising this,
begin to do it for her, and soon drive a tunnel leading
down to the roots of the grass, through which they lead
her, first, however, having clipped off her wings, which
are now but a useless encumbrance.</p>

<p class='c017'>Arrived at the terminus, the ants make a proper apartment
for their cow Aphis, and here, in the midst of warm
sympathisers, and with every comfort and luxury about
her, she no longer hesitates to lay her eggs. In due time
they hatch, producing wingless aphides, and from the
brood thus raised the ants obtain their honey. When,
however, this crawling generation have in turn produced
another winged one, the ants, far from seeking to detain
<a id='Page_143'></a>these in a place where they would only die, again set to
work to make tunnels, through which they conduct them
successively to the upper air. One tunnel, one would
think, would be sufficient for the purpose; but Lichtenstein,
who observed these facts in the south of France,<a id='r50'></a><a href='#f50' class='c016'><sup>[50]</sup></a>
states that each Aphis, as it issues from the egg, has a
separate one made for it by the ants. Having reached
the surface, these cave-born Ariels spread their wings and
fly away. Where they will settle no ant knows, but to the
community that has freed them they are lost, probably—they
and their eggs—for ever. Do the ants know this?
If they do, they do not repine at it, for they know also
that the perpetuation of the species, through which alone
they can hope for fresh honey, has been provided for. This
seems to me altogether to outdo the prudential feat of
<i><span lang="la">Lasius flavus</span></i>, and since <i><span lang="la">Lasius fuliginosus</span></i> is distributed
probably throughout the greater part of Europe, all the
nations that do honour to that portion of the earth’s
surface are at equal liberty to think of it with patriotic
complacency as “<i>our</i> ant.” For my part, I will only say
this, that, whether it is or not, I think it deserves to be a
Japanese ant—or that the Japanese, nowadays, much
more deserve to have it than we do: that perhaps is the
better way of putting it.</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_0_4 c015'>AS we have seen, both in this chapter and a former
one, aphides are not the only insects which yield
the ants honey—or something honey-sweet—and
are cherished by them in consequence. There are, for
instance, the coccidæ, or scale insects, as mentioned by
Belt; but whilst some of this family are milked in the
same way as the aphides, to which, indeed, they bear a
strong resemblance, others are simply eaten, as though
they were sweets. To them might be said in warning,
“Make yourself all honey, and the <i>ants</i> will swallow you,”
but who can modify the nature of his own juices? Then
there are the ants’-nest beetles, many of which have a
sweet downiness which the ants enjoy licking, and are
for this reason carried about with them when they move
from one place to another. Not that they are always
carried, for one little beetle, at any rate, whose name—it
must be a diminutive—is <i><span lang="la">Formicoxenus nitidulus</span></i>, is
accustomed to ride on the backs of its protectors, like the
little cockroaches discovered by Professor Wheeler.</p>

<p class='c017'>But perhaps the most interesting parallel to the
aphides, as cows, is to be found in certain caterpillars,
<a id='Page_145'></a>which are as soft and defenceless as they are, and represent
a class of creatures which ants habitually prey upon.
A certain family of butterflies, however, commonly known
as the Blues, but entitled to the scholarly name of
<i><span lang="la">Lycænidæ</span></i>, produce caterpillars which bear, upon the
twelfth segment of the body, a certain honey-holding
reservoir which, when full or nearly so, may be made to
yield its contents through the same treatment which is
so effectual in the case of the aphides. The ants tap or
titillate the body of the caterpillar, near where the gland
is situated, with their antennæ, and the caterpillars,
charmed with such affability, overflow in return. This
interesting fact has been observed in various parts of the
Old World, and also in North America; but the most
detailed account which we have of it comes from India.
In this case, as in all the others, the caterpillar is a quite
small one, and feeds on the leaves of a certain tree, bearing
both “an astringent yellow fruit” and the name of
<i><span lang="la">Zizyphus jujuba</span></i>, though, by the way, jujubes are not, as
a rule, astringent. The name of this little caterpillar—it
would scorn to be behind the tree it feeds on in such a
matter—is <i><span lang="la">Tarucus theophrastus</span></i>, so now we have something
to fix it in the memory. The ant that patronises
it is a large black one—<i>its</i> name I cannot give—and here,
too, as in the case of the aphidean relations, we have, in
the most noteworthy of the actions recorded, a very
remarkable instance of what looks like foresight, and
foresight, too, of a very large and general kind. In the
first place, the ants make a nest at the foot of the trees
in which the caterpillars reside, and here, during the
<a id='Page_146'></a>period of their growth and nourishment, they avail themselves
of their services. But when this period is over, and
the caterpillars are about to change into chrysalids, then
a strange scene takes place. All over the tree, ants are
now to be seen running about in a state of the greatest
excitement, and whenever they meet a caterpillar descending,
or preparing to descend, the trunk, in order to burrow
into the earth at its base, and there pass its pupal stage
of existence, they conduct it down themselves and relieve
it from the labour of digging, just in the same way as our
English ants do with the aphides.</p>

<p class='c017'>Still stranger is the scene which reveals itself if the
earth at the base of the tree be removed, for then it
is seen that chrysalids, and caterpillars that are about to
turn into chrysalids, are clinging all round the trunk,
whilst all amongst them are the ants, helping to place this
one or that one in position. The band thus formed
round the tree may be several inches broad, and it is
always remarkably even, as though arranged on æsthetic
principles. As the light shines in, the ants become
agitated, and seizing hold of their property—for in this
light they consider the caterpillars—begin to rebury them,
so that in time, if the annoyance continues, they will form
a fresh circle of bodies lower down the tree. Here, then,
is an ants’ nest, described as temporary by Mrs. Wyllie,
from whose interesting account<a id='r51'></a><a href='#f51' class='c016'><sup>[51]</sup></a> the above facts are taken,
full of butterfly chrysalids, and in about a week it
becomes full of butterflies themselves, and amidst the
rough, black bodies of hosts of earth-working Calibans,
<a id='Page_147'></a>colours born of the rainbow gleam and flash from the
fairy wings of delicate insect Ariels. Each one of these
was helped from its cradle, thus strangely situated, by
a little group of these gnomes, who then assisted it to
unfold its wings, and guided its uncertain steps. Later,
when strength has come to it, and something—it knows
not what—like an upward desire, these same gnomes will
lead it to the portals of their gloomy Hades, where it will
spread its wings and fly to meet the light. In so strange
a way, led by such uncouth guides, does Ariel find the sky.
Yet, as though the place of their new birth—gloomy
though it be and opposed to their light-loving natures—had
yet some nameless attraction for them, crowds of
these butterflies may be seen, for some time after their
exodus, hovering over the nest, before they leave it for
ever to dwell in the courts of the sun.</p>

<p class='c017'>Just as in the case of the aphides released by <i>Lasius
fuliginosus</i>, these ants will never see their butterflies again,
nor will they gain any after advantage that can with
certainty be traced to the particular individuals thus set
free. But they gain in such a manner as, if the reflection
really occurred to them, would make ants not much below
men. The process of reasoning would be this: “Though
we may very likely not get any caterpillars from the eggs
which these butterflies will lay, yet we ought not to kill
them, because then there would be so many butterflies
less in the world, to lay eggs, and if we did this every
year, and other ants too, caterpillars, as well as butterflies,
would become scarce, and at last we should not get
enough.” For myself I doubt if ants really do reason like
<a id='Page_148'></a>this, but by what steps this habit of releasing butterflies so
as to ensure the perpetuation of the species has come about,
I don’t quite see. In the case of the aphides, perhaps it
has been through actual observation of their habits, and
here, too, this hypothesis may not be excluded, since the
butterflies might well be seen laying their eggs, nor is it
unlikely that these are watched, and the issuing caterpillars
tended from the beginning. For the purposes of
the ants, indeed, all aphides, and every theophrastus,
would be the same, and they might very well think that
those which they found laying, or about to lay their eggs,
were the very ones previously liberated by them from the
nest. Thus the difficulty involved in supposing that they
must reason in a general and not merely in a particular
way does not really exist.</p>

<p class='c017'>Some of these black caterpillar-tending ants of India
are not always so lucky as to secure stock. They may live
far from a <i>jujube</i> tree, and so never meet the right species;
but if ever they do, even though it be in the most
unexpected manner, they are not taken by surprise,
notwithstanding that other caterpillars are habitually
devoured by them. Mrs. Wyllie proved this by an experiment.
“I took Theophrastus,” she tells us, “from a tree,
and introduced him on the pathway of another company
of the same species of ant, which lived in our verandah,
but kept no farm, and it was odd to see the ants come
tumbling out headlong to fight the intruder, and the
sudden way in which they cooled down on investigation
of the foe. None attempted to harm him, and he was
politely escorted across the boundary, the ants running
<a id='Page_149'></a>alongside and feeling him all over with their antennæ.
This must have been instinctive, as they could have had no
former knowledge of him as a ‘milk-giver.’” Mrs. Wyllie
adds that “the dead chrysalids in an ants’ nest are carefully
removed and thrown away outside; the ants also
distinguish between the dead and the living.”</p>

<p class='c017'>Anyone observing or reading about ants might exclaim,
on finding that they utilised the natural product of other
insects and kept them in captivity in order to do so,
“Where will this end? May they not, then, also keep
slaves?” And in very fact, as all the world now knows, we
do find what is called slavery amongst ants, though to me
it hardly seems the right word, since there is perfect willingness
on the part of the slave, and no power of punishment
lies with the master. There is equality, moreover,
since this is not a matter of the kind of things which
one class of a community does and another does not do,
but of the spirit in which each does them. With the
ants we have the Japanese spirit—or rather the Japanese
seem getting nearer to the ants—and so there is real
equality. However, the first act which makes these
creatures slaves—for I will use terms as I find them—is
one of violent and deadly hostility, and through it they
are, of set purpose, taken possession of and carried off to
the nest. At that period, however, they are yet in the
cradle, have yet to be born into their last and most perfect
state of life. From the moment they are so born
they grow up as a part, and indeed the most important
part, of the body politic, and of such pleasure and consideration
as obtains in ant-life they have their full share.</p>

<p class='c017'><a id='Page_150'></a>From the above it may be gathered that these ant-slaves
are ants themselves, and this, indeed, is the case.
One species of ant raids the nest of another, overpowers
the able-bodied inhabitants, slays or incapacitates a
certain number, and carries away with it to its own nest
as many of the helpless pupæ as it is able to. For a
great many years—thousands probably—these combats
and carrying off of spoil had been observed, but it had
always been imagined that the pupæ—or ants’ eggs, as
they are commonly called—were taken as provisions,
merely to be stored in the nest of the victor, and there
eaten at leisure. The discovery of the real truth was an
era in the study of ant-history, and it was made by a
Frenchman—Pierre Huber—a man of whom Darwin says
that he was a “better observer even than his celebrated
father,” for Pierre was the son of François Huber, the
blind man, who yet found out all about bees. I hardly see
how he can have been <i>better</i> myself; but the son was not
blind, and, of course, eyesight is an advantage in observation.</p>

<p class='c017'>The particular species of ant concerning which this
discovery was made is <i><span lang="la">Formica rufescens</span></i>, or <i>Polyergus
rufescens</i>—the reader may take his choice—and Darwin,
who impresses the facts of ant-slavery upon the mind
better than a dozen books specially devoted to ants or
insects, says of it: “This ant is absolutely dependent on
its slaves, and without their aid the species would certainly
become extinct in a single year. The males and fertile
females do no work of any kind, and the workers, or
sterile females, though most energetic and courageous in
capturing slaves, do no other work. They are incapable
<a id='Page_151'></a>of making their own nests or of feeding their own larvæ.
When the old nest is found inconvenient, and they have
to migrate, it is the slaves which determine the migration,
and actually carry their masters (one might just as well
call <i>them their</i> slaves) in their jaws. So utterly helpless
are the masters, that when Huber shut up thirty of them
without a slave, but with plenty of the food which they
like best, and with their own larvæ and pupæ to stimulate
them to work, they did nothing; they could not even
feed themselves, and many perished of hunger. Huber
then introduced a single slave, and she instantly set to
work, fed and saved the survivors, made some cells, and
tended the larvæ, and put all to rights. What can be
more extraordinary than these well-ascertained facts?”<a id='r52'></a><a href='#f52' class='c016'><sup>[52]</sup></a>
The slave-ant in this case is <i><span lang="la">Formica fusca</span></i>, and it is also
held in bondage by another species of slave-maker, viz.
<i><span lang="la">Formica sanguinea</span></i>—or the Blood-red Ant—as was likewise
a discovery of Pierre Huber. This last species is
found in the south of England, and its slave-making
habits have been observed by Darwin, who opened fourteen
nests and found a few slaves in all of them. “The
slaves,” he tells us, “are black, and not above half the
size of their red masters, so that the contrast in their
appearance is great.”<a href='#f52' class='c016'><sup>[52]</sup></a> The black ants were not often
seen by Darwin to leave the nest, and others who have
observed their habits in England have considered them
as “strictly household slaves.”<a href='#f52' class='c016'><sup>[52]</sup></a> Huber, however, whose
observations were carried on in Switzerland, says that
“their chief office is to search for aphides,”<a href='#f52' class='c016'><sup>[52]</sup></a> and this
would take them far afield. In Switzerland, however,
<a id='Page_152'></a>slaves seem to be more numerous in the nests of the
Blood-red Ant, and Darwin attributes the difference in
their habits to this account. Huber also tells us that
the Swiss slaves “habitually work with their masters in
making the nest, and they alone open and close the doors
in the morning and evening.”<a href='#f52' class='c016'><sup>[52]</sup></a> This is done, I suppose,
by placing pellets of earth in the mouth of the entrance-tunnel
and removing them again; but there is one species
of ant which would have only to place or remove itself,
for this purpose, since its large head, by being wedged
into the passage, stops it up, and thus fulfils the office of
a front door. The ant that does this must be one belonging
to a certain caste of workers having very large
heads, for the heads of the other ones would not be large
enough. The nest of this species is made in decaying
wood, and there is always some worker who thus uses his
large head as a stopper, removing it when a fellow-townsman
wishes to enter the nest, but presenting its
smooth, impenetrable surface, guarded with jaws, to all
unauthorised intruders. It is Forel, one of the best ant-observers
of to-day, who tells us this, and the ant
apparently is <i><span lang="la">Lasius fuliginosus</span></i>, which is a British species,
and, according to an account which I have already referred
to, does not seem to be always a wood-borer. <i>Formica
sanguinea</i>, however, does things—or has things done for
it—after a more ordinary fashion.</p>

<p class='c017'>Darwin was the witness of a slave-raid on the part
of <i><span lang="la">F. sanguinea</span></i> which was not, in this instance, very
successful. He says: “They approached, and were
vigorously repulsed by an independent community of the
<a id='Page_153'></a>slave-species (<i><span lang="la">F. fusca</span></i>), sometimes as many as three of
these ants clinging to the legs of the slave-making
<i><span lang="la">sanguinea</span></i>. The latter ruthlessly killed their small
opponents, and carried their dead bodies as food to their
nest, twenty-nine yards distant; but they were prevented
from getting any pupæ to rear as slaves. I then dug up
a small parcel of the pupæ of <i><span lang="la">Formica fusca</span></i> from another
nest, and put them down on a bare spot near the place
of combat; they were eagerly seized and carried off by
the tyrants, who perhaps fancied that, after all, they had
been victorious in their late combat.”<a href='#f52' class='c016'><sup>[52]</sup></a> In his work,
<i>Ants and their Ways</i>,<a id='r53'></a><a href='#f53' class='c016'><sup>[53]</sup></a> the Rev. Farren White describes a
similar raid which was—or rather which had been, for it
was nearly over when he arrived on the scene—wholly
successful. Here, however, the oppressed species seems
to have made a very poor resistance, though very likely
it had been more vigorous in the earlier stages of the
raid. “I watched a <i><span lang="la">fusca</span></i>,” says Mr. White, “carrying
off a pupa from behind the entrance whence the <i><span lang="la">sanguineæ</span></i>
were issuing forth. Immediately it saw one of the enemy
approaching, it dropped its charge and left it to its fate.
The <i><span lang="la">sanguinea</span></i> then gave it a push, and drove it off in
double-quick time”; and, again, “I noticed a <i><span lang="la">sanguinea</span></i>
coming up out of the nest with a pupa, and a <i><span lang="la">fusca</span></i>,
observing it, went up a fern-frond with the utmost expedition.”<a href='#f53' class='c016'><sup>[53]</sup></a>
Other observations of a similar nature were
made, and the conclusion arrived at by Mr. White is
“that between the <i><span lang="la">fuscæ</span></i> and the <i><span lang="la">sanguineæ</span></i> there is a
well-defined and clearly pronounced antagonism. In
presence of the <i><span lang="la">sanguineæ</span></i> the <i><span lang="la">fuscæ</span></i> were terror-stricken.
<a id='Page_154'></a>In fact the depredators had it all their own way, and
were able in this instance, at least, to carry out their
marvellous instincts without destroying a single life.”<a href='#f53' class='c016'><sup>[53]</sup></a>
It will be seen how ill this accords with the account given
by Darwin. My own way of accounting for the discrepancy
is that, in the first instance, the little <i><span lang="la">fuscæ</span></i> were
flushed with success, and, in the second, demoralised
through defeat. The same effects would follow the same
causes in all but the most splendid human armies.</p>

<p class='c017'>The raids made by the first-mentioned species, <i>Polyergus
rufescens</i>, or, as Huber calls them, the Amazon ants, are
of an even more determined description, for none are
braver, or perhaps so brave. If one of these should find
herself alone and in the midst of enemies, she makes no
effort to escape, as many, though not all, other species
would, but fights on to the end, making constant agile
leaps to this side or that, at every one of which she transfixes
an enemy, and dies at last biting hard. To fight,
indeed, is the whole end, aim, and business of life for an
Amazon, and we have already seen how they do no work,
and are washed, fed, and carried by their servants. It is
not quite true, however, that they cannot feed themselves,
as Pierre Huber thought, and had good reason to think,
for a well-known living observer—Herr Wasmann—has
discovered that their mandibles are so constructed as to
enable them “to absorb nourishment from eggs or pupæ.”
Possibly the mandibles are hollow, and communicate thus
with the mouth, as is the case with some other insects,
but I have not Wasmann’s account at hand, and his
exponent says only this. Wasmann tells us also that
these Amazons will “absorb nourishment,” however they do
<a id='Page_155'></a>it, even from the eggs of their own species. They cannot,
however, feed on liquid food, and as they had no other when
shut up without servants, that is why they died, or would
have died, had these not been brought them in time. So
too, though their slaves wash and brush them, yet they
are always brushing themselves and attending generally to
their own toilette, and this they do even amidst</p>

  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“All the currents of a heady fight,”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c015'>so that Wasmann has compared them to the Spartans combing
their long hair before the battle of Thermopylæ, though
we are not told that they combed it after the fight had
begun.</p>

<p class='c017'>Still, it seems plain that the habit of keeping slaves has
exercised a degrading influence on these ants, and this
tendency is much more markedly apparent in several other
species. One of these with a really dreadful name,
<i><span lang="la">Strongylognathus</span></i>—we might call them Strong Ants, but
they seem to be weak ones—is described by Forel as “<i>une
triste caricature</i>” of the Amazons, and the extraordinary
thing is that, though themselves feeble and enervated,
they manage to make, or by some means obtain as slaves,
the workers of a much more robust species—<i><span lang="la">Tetramorium</span></i>,
to wit; workers, by the way, are the only class of ants ever
enslaved. These weak ants fight in the same way as
the Amazons themselves; but, though spirited enough,
they are so much inferior in bodily vigour to the <i><span lang="la">Tetramoriums</span></i>,
“a courageous species living in large communities,
that in a battle between the two, artificially
instigated by Forel, almost all the slave-holders were
killed, without being able to avenge their deaths even on a
single one of those whom they aspired to rule.” Yet they
<a id='Page_156'></a>won the day, or rather the already enslaved <i><span lang="la">Tetramoriums</span></i>,
who marched to do battle for them, won it for the few
survivors in their ranks. From this we can see how, when
these decadents once have slaves, they may get more. The
difficulty is how they are obtained in the first instance—when
a nest is first founded by a queen of the slave-making
species, for example. It might be supposed, finding two
kinds of ants living together, one weaker and much more
helpless than the other, that the former lived a parasitic
existence in the nest of the latter, and was not a slave-owner
at all; but this theory is disproved by the fact that
no males or females of the <i><span lang="la">Tetramoriums</span></i> are ever to be
found, showing that it is not they but the others who are
the true founders of the nest.</p>

<p class='c017'>A still more extraordinary instance of a slave-holding
species of ant than the one just mentioned is <i>Anergates
atratulus</i>, for in this there are no workers at all, only
kings and queens, who are waited on, and their eggs and
larvæ fed and tended, by the slave species—<i><span lang="la">Tetramorium</span></i>,
in this case also—just as though these latter were their
true-born subjects. Here too the slave species is only
represented by workers. These male and female <i><span lang="la">Anergates</span></i>—a
worker of the species has never been known—are
both few in number and weak in themselves. When a
pair of them (or a fertilised queen) go off to found a new
colony, how do they, or how do their few weak descendants,
impress a strong fierce species into their service, by
whom the nest is built, and every other service performed?
The question remains unanswered. Nobody knows.
Several theories have been advanced, one by Sir John
Lubbock, who supposes that the king and queen of <i><span lang="la">Anergates</span></i>
<a id='Page_157'></a>assassinate the queen of <i><span lang="la">Tetramorium</span></i> and reign in
her stead,<a id='r54'></a><a href='#f54' class='c016'><sup>[54]</sup></a> and another, more recently, by Wasmann,
whose idea is that fertile queens of <i><span lang="la">Anergates</span></i> are sometimes
adopted by a colony of <i><span lang="la">Tetramoriums</span></i> who have lost
their own queen. This last is the newest suggestion, and
is considered just at present, perhaps for that reason, the
most probable. To me Sir John Lubbock’s view seems
likelier to be correct, since it is more usual in nature for
the weak to prey, as parasites, upon the strong, than for
the strong to seek assistance of the weak. True, I can
form no idea as to how the assassination of the rightful
queen takes place, but Nature is full of resources, and will
do much to promote a really worthy end.</p>

<p class='c017'>I will conclude this chapter by quoting some remarks of
Sir John Lubbock as to the ill effects which the institution
of slavery exercises, with ants as with men, upon the
character of the slave-holder. “These four genera,” he
says, “offer us every gradation from lawless violence to
contemptible parasitism. <i><span lang="la">Formica sanguinea</span></i>, which may
be assumed to have comparatively recently taken to slave-making,
has not, as yet, been materially affected. <i><span lang="la">Polyergus</span></i>,
on the contrary, already illustrates the lowering
tendency of slavery. They have lost their knowledge of
art and their natural affection for their young! They
are, however, bold and powerful marauders. In <i><span lang="la">Strongylognathus</span></i>
the enervating influence of slavery has gone
further, and told even on the bodily strength. They are
no longer able to capture their slaves in fair and open
warfare. Still, they retain a semblance of authority, and,
when roused, will fight bravely, though in vain. In <i><span lang="la">Anergates</span></i>,
finally, we come to the last scene of this sad
<a id='Page_158'></a>history. We may safely conclude that in distant times
their ancestors lived, as so many ants do now, partly by
hunting, partly on honey; that by degrees they became
bold marauders, and gradually took to keeping slaves;
that for a time they maintained their strength and agility,
though losing, by degrees, their real independence, their
arts, and even many of their instincts; that gradually
even their bodily force dwindled away under the enervating
influence to which they had subjected themselves,
until they sank to their present degraded condition—weak
in body and mind, few in numbers, and, apparently, nearly
extinct, the miserable representatives of far superior ancestors,
maintaining a precarious existence as contemptible
parasites of their former slaves.”<a id='r55'></a><a href='#f55' class='c016'><sup>[55]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c017'>Since, however, in all these cases the masters are still
truly served by their slaves, who make them comfortable,
and have no more sense of their degradation than they
themselves have, an answer might be made to these moralisings.
However various the masks behind which true
motives lie hid, happiness, diversely conceived of, is the
one end and aim of all. Does it, then, really much
matter by what means it is attained? Till we can show
that these slave-holding ants have become less and less
happy, we are only tilting at shadows, and an <i><span lang="la">Anergates</span></i>
might very well say, in regard to the above view, “Tut,
prut, drop your heroics. I am very comfortable; these
strong fellows work for me. I like not working, and what
I am I wish to be.”</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_0_4 c015'>THE relation of slave and slave-master—to use the
received terminology—is not the only one of a
social and friendly nature in which ants of different
species stand towards one another; for as will have been
gathered in the previous chapter, slavery amongst ants is
a quite friendly institution, conducted, in fact, upon the
“liberty-equality-fraternity” principle. Some species of
ants, however, inhabit the nests of other species, or build
their own amidst theirs in such a way as almost to make
them one, and thus they live as perpetual guests, not only
without paying for such accommodation by rendering their
hosts any services, but often forcing these latter to be of
service to them in other ways also. Thus, a small species
of Texan ant whose first or Christian name is <i><span lang="la">Leptothorax</span></i>,
but whose surname has not yet been fixed upon, lives on
these terms in the nests of a larger one, the celebrated
<i><span lang="la">Myrmica brevinodis</span></i>. Whether Professor Wheeler was
the discoverer of the little ant I am not quite sure, but
he was the first, I think, to observe its relations with the
big one and those of the big one with it, and his account
<a id='Page_160'></a>of them is excessively interesting. “A small dish,” he
says, “containing a syrup of sugar and water was placed
near the nest (an artificial one under close observation).
This was soon found by two of the <i><span lang="la">Myrmica</span></i> workers,
which at once gorged themselves with the liquid and
returned into the nest.”<a id='r56'></a><a href='#f56' class='c016'><sup>[56]</sup></a> Soon afterwards a <i><span lang="la">Leptothorax</span></i>
worker entered it also, and having run or tracked down
one of the two honey-gorged creatures, forthwith got up
on to its back, and, seated there, began to lick its head,
an attention which it supplemented with a soft, persuasive
titillation with its antennæ, whilst at the same time communicating
a motion to its abdomen, which Professor
Wheeler is so convinced must have been accompanied with
certain sounds—known to the learned as stridulations—that
he does not hesitate to affirm that it was thrown
“into stridulatory oscillation.” Nor was the <i><span lang="la">Myrmica</span></i> deaf
to such an appeal. It slackened its pace, hesitated, then
paused, and as though unable longer to resist the influence,
folded its antennæ and appeared to give itself up
to the full pleasure of the thing. The tempter, now, still
making soft play with the antennæ, lowered its own head,
and began to lick the <i><span lang="la">Myrmica</span></i> first on one cheek and then
the other, including also the mandibles and parts adjoining.
Thus fostered, a dewy moisture, drawn evidently
from the reservoir of lately swallowed nectar, began to
glisten on the lips of the large ant, and, increasing rapidly
to a droplet, was re-imbibed by the expectant little one.
“The latter,” says Professor Wheeler, “then dismounted,
ran to another <i><span lang="la">Myrmica</span></i>, climbed on its back, and repeated
the very same performance. Again it took toll, and passed
<a id='Page_161'></a>on to still another <i><span lang="la">Myrmica</span></i>.”<a href='#f56' class='c016'><sup>[56]</sup></a> Up to the present the
attention of Professor Wheeler had been concentrated on
the doings of this one individual, but now, turning his
attention to other parts of the nest, he “observed that
nearly all the <i><span lang="la">Leptothorax</span></i> workers were similarly employed.
In one corner a number of <i><span lang="la">Myrmica</span></i> workers had
formed a circle about a few of their small larvæ, which
they were cleansing and feeding. A <i><span lang="la">Leptothorax</span></i> soon
found its way to this cluster, and stepped from the back
of one ant to that of another, lavishing a shampoo on
each in turn, and apparently filling its crop with the
liquid contributions thus solicited.”</p>

<p class='c017'>The above method of obtaining food appears to be
peculiar to these ant parasites. Beetles, for example,
solicit it either by taps or touches with the antennæ—which
is a similar one indeed, but does not go so far nor
involve a ride—or else by stroking the face of their host
with their fore-feet. Other species of ants, when soliciting
food from one another or demanding it from their
slaves, employ a more or less similar method, whilst the
<i><span lang="la">Lepismid</span></i> that we have before spoken of is a thief pure
and simple. Licking seems to be the personal discovery
of <i><span lang="la">Leptothorax</span></i>, and being licked the peculiar privilege of
<i><span lang="la">Myrmica brevinodis</span></i>. That it is a valued one is clear, but
the price asked for it is not always forthcoming, possibly
because there is not always anything to forthcome. On
such barren occasions <i><span lang="la">Leptothorax</span></i> makes the best of a bad
job, and dismounting from its first love, runs about looking
for another.</p>

<p class='c017'>Sometimes, after having licked the head and face of its
<a id='Page_162'></a>patron, the poor petitioner turns round and proceeds to
do the same by its abdomen. This, perhaps, is a last
effort of persuasion, but Professor Wheeler rather supposes
the surface of <i><span lang="la">Myrmica’s</span></i> body to be “covered with
some agreeable secretion.” Queen <i><span lang="la">Myrmicas</span></i>, however,
seem to be very rarely treated to any sort of licking, and
males apparently never. The reason of this, probably, is
that both queens and males are themselves accustomed to
receive their food from the workers by a similar process of
regurgitation, and are probably therefore not in the habit
of regurgitating it. They are therefore neglected by the
little parasites, who console themselves by being all the
more insistent with those who have something to give.
These—that is to say, the workers—are waylaid whenever
they enter the nest, as having presumably found something
to eat outside it, and, in order to be on the spot, at once
their importunate lickers, who seem to live in a perpetual
state of crying, “Give! give!” keep in the more or less
immediate proximity of the entrance, or entrances, should
there be more than one. Professor Wheeler, indeed,
doubts if the <i><span lang="la">Leptos</span></i> ever feed themselves in the ordinary
way, but inasmuch as they were on one occasion seen by
him to do so, such doubt appears to me to be uncalled for.</p>

<p class='c017'>These little ants make, in regard to the big ones within
whose nest they live, a sort of <i><span lang="la">imperium in imperio</span></i>. In a
small chamber surrounded by the large galleries of the
<i><span lang="la">Myrmicas</span></i>, and communicating with these by a passage too
narrow for the latter to pass through, lives the queen
with a small number of workers; eight of them in the
nest observed by Professor Wheeler, together with a few
<a id='Page_163'></a>larvæ, almost filling the cavity. They appear to be on
affectionate terms with one another, the workers feeding
their queen in the most assiduous manner, and she often
playing with them like a cat with her kittens, throwing
them on to their backs, and then “hugging and kissing
them” (as Professor Wheeler describes it) <i><span lang="it">con amore</span></i>. Not
that the Professor himself takes this view of it, for after
hesitating whether to ascribe such behaviour to maternal
affection, “the play instinct,” or hunger, he decides for
the latter—on what grounds, since there was a continual
passage of viands from one ant to another, the queen
especially being “assiduously fed,” I am unable to see.
What, too, is “the play instinct,” except a mere term
made use of in order to suggest the idea of automatism
in regard to an act which hardly seems to admit of such
an interpretation? Instincts represent imperious necessities
which, if not attended to, the species must fail or
perish. Such, at any rate, are the grounds on which they
must be supposed to have been originally built up. But
what creature has had to play in order to survive? Not
ants, surely, who work so hard that they cannot stand in
need of more exercise than their daily life affords them.
Nor, it would seem, is such an instinct developed amongst
other insects, which again seems to show that it cannot be
of any great importance. When, therefore, we find that
ants, the most wonderful of all insects, do play, this
strongly suggests their possession of an intelligence
analogous to that of the higher animals. Instinct,
however, is largely independent of intelligence, such as we
understand it, and therefore, to allude to “the play
<a id='Page_164'></a>instinct” in ants before the instinctive character of the
act has been made out, is to prejudge the question whether
ants are automatic or reasoning beings.</p>

<p class='c017'>The smallness of the passages leading from the interior
chamber of <i><span lang="la">Leptothorax</span></i> to the broad galleries of the
<i><span lang="la">Myrmicas</span></i> suggests that the latter were not intended to pass
through them; but we cannot really draw this inference,
since an ant in tunnelling would allow for the size of its own
body, but not for that of another species. Certain it is that
the big ants constantly force their way through the narrow
passages, thus partly breaking down the wall, and that
they are then received by the little ones in a quite friendly
manner, and persuaded to part with some of their interior
stores. Still, when this has been effected, their friends
seem mildly desirous that they should go, and, as soon as
they have gone, set to work to repair the breaches made
by their entrance. No sooner has this been done, however,
than they are broken down again, and so it may continue,
apparently, for an indefinite period, at any rate in nests
constructed for observational purposes, and where the
conditions are, therefore, more or less artificial. Whether
it is so to anything like the same extent under nature
may well be doubted, for that any creature should live in
a state of never-ending useless labour does not seem likely;
and, moreover, unless the one ant could have made itself
comfortable within the nest of the other, why should it
have become established there at all? But whatever it
may be outside the study, this is Professor Wheeler’s
account of what fell under his observation: “At one
p.m.,” he tells us, “the <i><span lang="la">Myrmica</span></i> workers discovered the
<a id='Page_165'></a>hiding-place of their little companions, and two of them,
in single file, shouldered their way through the narrow
passage, enlarging it as they proceeded. As soon as the
head of the first <i><span lang="la">Myrmica</span></i> appeared in the chamber, the
<i><span lang="la">Leptothoraxes</span></i> which had been attending to their morning
toilet and that of their larvæ, and to the careful arrangement
of their eggs, turned to meet the intruders.”</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c018'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in4'>“Now dreadful deeds</div>
      <div class='line'>Might have ensued,”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c015'>and for such an upshot, indeed, upon the first occasion,
Professor Wheeler was prepared. “For an instant,” he says,
“I fully expected to see a fierce battle, but I had misjudged
the <i><span lang="la">Leptothorax</span></i> character. To my surprise the <i><span lang="la">Myrmicas</span></i>
on entering were received with a profusion of shampooing,
and, though sadly crowding the occupants of the little
chamber, they let themselves down comfortably, and
appeared to experience all the sensuous satisfaction of a
couple of <i><span lang="fr">roués</span></i> who have dropped into a Turkish bath
for the night. Yet the little <i>Leptos</i>, though behaving in
this friendly manner” (their conduct indeed was not more
disinterested than upon other occasions), “seemed to have
some dim desire to remove the <i><span lang="la">Myrmicas</span></i> from their nest,
for from time to time one was seen to pull with her
mandibles at the fore leg or antenna of one of the
intruders, as if to remind her that there are limits to
polite hospitality.” Professor Wheeler adds that “this
was the only act even approaching hostility witnessed
between the two species. The <i><span lang="la">Myrmicas</span></i> never showed the
slightest irritation towards the <i><span lang="la">Leptos</span></i>, never seized them
in their mandibles or even menaced them. They seemed
<a id='Page_166'></a>rather to look upon the little creatures with gentle
benevolence, much as human adults regard little children.
They never passed their little guests without the antennal
greeting, and the <i><span lang="la">Leptos</span></i> shampooed their hosts with
comical zeal.”<a href='#f56' class='c016'><sup>[56]</sup></a> The continued breaking down and repair
of the dividing wall is then described, with the conclusion
that “in their natural environment the <i><span lang="la">Leptothoraxes</span></i> would
not be cramped for space, and would probably dig their
cell where they would not so frequently be disturbed by
their inquisitive hosts.”</p>

<p class='c017'>As regards the possible effects upon the <i><span lang="la">Myrmicas</span></i> of
having thus frequently to render up food swallowed for
their own nourishment, it must be remembered that
amongst most ants this is a thing of custom; and, again,
it seems probable that there would be an internal sense
on the part of the regurgitating individual as to concessions
of this nature having gone as far as it was healthy
that they should go. As we have seen, they are not infrequently
refused. Professor Wheeler, however, came to the
conclusion that <i><span lang="la">Myrmica</span></i> colonies suffer very considerably
from this cause, and on this he makes the following
comment: “If I have correctly estimated the influences
which may tend to diminish the fecundity and prosperity
of the <i><span lang="la">Myrmicas</span></i>, we have in this double nest another
striking demonstration of the complete absence in ants
of any faculty of reason. For if the <i><span lang="la">Myrmicas</span></i> possessed
a glimmer of this faculty they could easily annihilate the
gluttonous little nest-mates that are for ever roaming
about their galleries like so many animated stomach-pumps.”<a href='#f56' class='c016'><sup>[56]</sup></a>
Yes, truly a <i>most</i> “striking demonstration,”
<a id='Page_167'></a>seeing that we human ants can annihilate, all in a
moment, any evil that has insensibly gained a footing
amongst us, and with which we have been familiarised
from birth. Custom, growing gradually from unnoticed
beginnings, plays no part at all amongst us—never affects
our views in the very slightest degree. In Europe we
hang up all the brewers and distillers; whilst mobs of
infuriated Chinamen rend in pieces the vendors of opium
and crushers of their women’s feet. There is no such
thing in <i>human</i> nature as tolerating an evil for the
pleasure that lives in it; no <i>man</i> ruins his health, and
sinks into an early grave, through being a slave to sensual
pleasures. Nor can what is manifestly wrong seem right to
<i>us</i>; there is no pernicious, obstinate, wilful shutting of <i>our</i>
eyes. What a contrast does all this present with such a
state of affairs as we are here considering! And how
plain it is that there can be no reasoning power in the
ant, since reason and right conduct are synonymous with
man!</p>

<p class='c017'>What is the origin of these strange co-partnerships—for
there are others—which we find existing between
ants of two different species living in the same or in one
double nest? As we know, the different species of ants
are commonly very hostile to one another; and for any
to enter the nest of some other one is to court destruction,
if they be not the stronger party. Nay, they dare not
even enter a strange nest of their own species. It seems
probable, therefore—this, at least, is my own view of
it—that such friendly cohabitation has come about
through the channel, not of peace, but of war—through
<a id='Page_168'></a>successful encroachments which, from being unavoidable,
have come gradually to be less and less resented,
till the two parties, mingling freely, have learnt to
live on other terms. Now there are ants which live,
like ogres, in the nests of other species, preying upon
their eggs and young. Such a one is <i><span lang="la">Solenopsis fugax</span></i>—to
whom we will come presently—but it is perhaps even
more interesting to find in species between whom relations
of a similar nature to those which we have been considering
exist, occasional slight traces of a mutual hostility.
As between the <i><span lang="la">Leptos</span></i> and <i><span lang="la">Myrmicas</span></i> indeed this has only
as yet been noticed, very faintly, on the part of the
former; but in regard to another pair who live together—our
great wood-ant, namely, <i><span lang="la">Formica rufa</span></i> and tiny little
<i><span lang="la">Formicoxenus nitidulus</span></i>—Professor Wheeler remarks: “On
one occasion in one of my artificial nests, in which the
ants had previously lived on good terms with one another,
I saw a <i><span lang="la">Formica</span></i> touching a <i><span lang="la">Formicoxenus</span></i> with her
antennæ and menacing her with her mandibles, but she
departed without even attempting to seize her. In the
same nest I found a <i><span lang="la">Formicoxenus</span></i> which had seized
the leg of a <i><span lang="la">Formica</span></i> in its mandibles and had died in
this position.”<a id='r57'></a><a href='#f57' class='c016'><sup>[57]</sup></a> Other observers, too, have from time to
time—but only very occasionally—noticed facts of the
same sort. Through such exceptional slight indications
we may perhaps see, “as in a glass darkly,” what things
were at the beginning.</p>

<p class='c017'>Let us now look at the beginning. <i><span lang="la">Solenopsis fugax</span></i>,
Sir John Lubbock tells us, “makes its chambers and
galleries in the walls of the nests of larger species, and
<a id='Page_169'></a>is the bitter enemy of its hosts. The latter cannot get
at them because they are too large to enter the galleries.
The little <i><span lang="la">Solenopses</span></i>, therefore, are quite safe, and, as
it appears, make incursions into the nurseries of the
larger ant and carry off the larvæ as food. It is as if
we had small dwarfs about eighteen inches to two feet
long harbouring in the walls of our houses and every now
and then carrying off some of our children into their
horrid dens.”<a id='r58'></a><a href='#f58' class='c016'><sup>[58]</sup></a> This is the general proposition. Monsieur
Janet can add a few particulars. “The <i><span lang="la">Solenopsis</span></i>,” he
says, “may establish itself near almost any other ants
of our country, and is found especially with....” Here
follows a list all in Latin, but our common Wood-ant—the
large one that makes those great heaps of pine-needles—and
the Amazon, or slave-making ant, are contained in
it.<a id='r59'></a><a href='#f59' class='c016'><sup>[59]</sup></a> “The <i><span lang="la">Solenopsis</span></i> nest,” continues M. Janet, “may
partially surround that of its neighbour’s, or it may even
be partly excavated in the masses of earth which separate
the galleries of the latter. In each case—and probably,
too, when, as is frequent, there is not such close contiguity—fine
connecting galleries enable the <i><span lang="la">Solenopsis</span></i> to make
incursions into the nests of their neighbours, where, as
we shall see, they find an abundance of food. The actual
nest consists of a number of small circular chambers
about 8-20 mm. in diameter and only 6-8 mm. in height.
Most of these chambers are separated from one another
by several centimetres, and are connected by slender
galleries, often less than two millimetres in diameter,
entering the chambers at their walls, ceilings, or floors,
which latter are remarkably clean, smooth, and hard.”<a href='#f59' class='c016'><sup>[59]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c017'><a id='Page_170'></a>The food of which these horrid little ants find such an
abundance is, of course, the cocoons and larvæ of their
unfortunate neighbours, and M. Janet gives the following
account of the way in which they dispose of them:
“From ten to thirty of them,” he says, “climb up on to
a cocoon and cover it with little perforations which,
finally, becoming confluent, enable them to reach its
contents. If it contains a pupa, the legs and antennæ
fall an easy prey to the mandibles of the <i><span lang="la">Solenopses</span></i>. In
this case the victim is cut into, sucked, and torn into very
small pieces, which the ants hasten to carry away into the
interior of the nest. The operation is much more difficult
in the case of a larva which has just spun its cocoon.
Such a one I have seen the <i><span lang="la">Solenopses</span></i> drag into the
interior of the nest and keep working at for twenty-four
hours. At the expiration of this period the larva
began to look flaccid (as may be believed), and was
covered with little black dots which were, sometimes,
double, corresponding with the little wounds made by the
mandibles of its assassins. Numbers of the latter were
busy lapping up the liquid which exuded from the
wounds, but it was not until thirty-six hours had elapsed
that the larva was entirely devoured.”<a href='#f59' class='c016'><sup>[59]</sup></a> This is certainly
not a pleasant picture, yet, if our surmise is correct, the
remote descendants of these murderous <i><span lang="la">Solenopses</span></i> may
become as harmless and as pretty in their ways as the
little <i><span lang="la">Leptos</span></i>, a reflection which goes far to discount any
uncomfortable feelings we might otherwise have been
inclined to have in regard to the general plan or scheme
of things. Thus, in nature, though occasionally a slight
<a id='Page_171'></a>shadow may seem to rest upon the landscape, the next
moment the very memory of it is lost in a blaze of sunlight
glory.</p>

<p class='c017'>Forel believes that when a <i><span lang="la">Solenopsis</span></i>, and one of the
larger species of ants that it plagues, meet, the latter are
unable to see it on account of its small size, so that,
practically, it is invisible. This seems a strange doctrine,
since the same ants can see smaller things; and yet, from
their behaviour under such circumstances, M. Janet is
inclined to think so too. It can hardly be that they
shun combat, though the <i><span lang="la">Solenopses</span></i>, in spite of their small
size, are able, even here, by virtue of their numbers, and
being armed with stings, to meet their victims, as one
may almost call them, upon equal terms. M. Janet,
indeed, once saw so strong and warlike a species as the
slave-making <i><span lang="la">Formica sanguinea</span></i> killed by some half-dozen
<i><span lang="la">Solenopses</span></i>, but he adds that on such occasions a considerable
number of the latter were, generally, killed also.
This, however, is not sufficient to abate the evil, so
perhaps the molested species, finding that fighting is of no
use, accustomed to see <i><span lang="la">Solenopses</span></i> from their birth, recognising,
too, as a part of their own atmosphere, the
distinctive smell which they, no doubt, possess, accept
them like some disagreeable part of their lives, and try to
make the best of it.</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_4_0_4 c015'>ANTS, as everybody knows, have a special faculty for
doing extraordinary things. Only a few of these
have been mentioned in the last and preceding
chapters, and only a few more can be touched upon in this.
To do the subject anything like justice, a whole large
book would be required, not a few chapters merely of a
quite small one. What ants do, indeed, reminds me of
the refrain, constantly repeated, of a certain old ballad
lately brought to my notice, viz.—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c018'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Wonders, notable wonders! never the like was heard.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c015'>For instance, they grow mushrooms (rice, or some
cereals, they used to grow and reap, but lately they have
not been allowed to); they use their own larvæ as an
implement to sew or stick things together with, thus
making little shuttles of them; they make bridges of
their own bodies, by which they pass over rivers—even
wide ones, it would seem, at least for them—which otherwise
would be impassable; they allow themselves to be
<a id='Page_173'></a>made into honey-pots and kept full for the good of the
general community, who take a little of them when they
want it; they have cemeteries, and would appear even
to feel something like awe or respect in the presence of
their own dead; they cause certain plants to grow and
come to maturity, which would otherwise die, in order to
make a house in them, and so on and so on, many other
wonders equally notable, to say nothing of those which
have already been recounted.</p>

<p class='c017'>To take the first on the list—I hardly believe in a
classification of wonders—Belt, who was an engineer, but
ought to have given up his whole life to observations of
this sort, was the first, I believe, to find out that ants
were mushroom-growers. Like others, when he came to
Nicaragua he saw the leaf-cutting ants passing in long,
double columns backwards and forwards between their
nests and the trees, the homeward-bound column laden
with their little crescent-shaped bits of green leaf, the
outgoing one empty-handed. “The first acquaintance a
stranger generally makes with them,” says Belt, “is on
encountering their paths on the outskirts of the forest
crowded with the ants; one lot carrying off the pieces of
leaves, each piece about the size of a sixpence, and held
up vertically between the jaws of the ant; another lot
hurrying along in an opposite direction empty-handed,
but eager to get loaded with their leafy burdens. If
he follows this last division, it will lead him to some
young trees or shrubs, up which the ants mount; and
where each one, stationing itself on the edge of a leaf,
commences to make a circular cut, with its scissor-like
<a id='Page_174'></a>jaws, from the edge, its hinder feet being the centre on
which it turns. When the piece is nearly cut off it is
still stationed upon it, and it looks as though it would
fall to the ground with it, but on being finally detached
the ant is generally found to have hold of the leaf with
one foot, and soon righting itself, and arranging its
burden to its satisfaction, it sets off at once on its
return. Following it again, it is seen to join a throng of
others, each laden like itself, and, without a moment’s
delay, it hurries along the well-worn path. As it proceeds,
other paths, each thronged with busy workers, come
in from the sides, until the main road often gets to be
seven or eight inches broad, and more thronged than
the streets of the city of London. Standing near the
mounds, one sees from every point of the compass ant-paths
leading to them, all thronged with the busy
workers carrying their leafy burdens. As far as the eye
can distinguish their tiny forms, troops upon troops of
leaves are moving up towards the central point and disappearing
down the numerous tunnelled passages. The
outgoing empty-handed hosts are partly concealed
amongst the bulky burdens of the incomers, and can only
be distinguished by looking closely amongst them.”<a id='r60'></a><a href='#f60' class='c016'><sup>[60]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c017'>It used to be supposed that these leaves themselves, in
a decaying state, were the food of the ants, whilst another
theory was that they were used to make a sort of underground
roof to the nest with. Belt’s discovery took everybody—including
himself—completely by surprise. “I
believe,” he says, “the real use they make of them is as a
manure, on which grows a minute species of fungus, on
<a id='Page_175'></a>which they feed: that they are in reality mushroom
growers and eaters”;<a href='#f60' class='c016'><sup>[60]</sup></a> and he thus narrates the circumstances
which led him to this conclusion:—</p>

<p class='c017'>“When I first began my warfare against the ants that
attacked my garden, I dug down deeply into some of their
nests. In our mining operations we also, on two occasions,
carried our excavations from below up through very large
formicariums, so that all their underground workings were
exposed to observation. I found their nests below to consist
of numerous rounded chambers, about as large as
a man’s head, connected together by tunnelled passages
leading from one chamber to another. Notwithstanding
that many columns of the ants were continually carrying
in the cut leaves, I could never find any quantity of these
in the burrows, and it was evident that they were used up
in some way immediately they were brought in. The
chambers were always about three-parts filled with a
speckled brown flocculent, spongy-looking mass of a light
and loosely connected substance. This mass, which I have
called the ant-food, proved on examination to be composed
of minutely subdivided pieces of leaves, withered to
a brown colour and overgrown and lightly connected
together by a minute white fungus that ramified in every
direction throughout it.”<a href='#f60' class='c016'><sup>[60]</sup></a> Belt assured himself in many
ways, but not through actually seeing them do so, that
this fungus was what the ants fed on, and he adds, “that
they do not eat the leaves themselves I convinced myself;
for I found near the tenanted chambers deserted ones
filled with the refuse particles of leaves that had been
exhausted as manure for the fungus, and were now left,
<a id='Page_176'></a>and served as food for larvæ of <i><span lang="la">Staphylinidæ</span></i> and other
beetles.”<a href='#f60' class='c016'><sup>[60]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c017'>Belt’s conclusions have been since amply verified, and
the actual process of preparing the leaves and laying down
the mushroom-beds, as well as the clipping and—if I mistake
not—eating of the mushrooms, has been observed.
Herr Möller—a German observer who resided for some
years in tropical America—is usually referred to in this connection;
but such extracts from his writings as I have come
across are to me less <i>convincing</i> than the following account
of Mr. Edward Tanner, which is contained in the <i>Journal
of the Trinidad Field Club</i>.<a id='r61'></a><a href='#f61' class='c016'><sup>[61]</sup></a> The observations were made
with ants in confinement, as were Herr Möller’s also, I
believe. “Each forager,” says Mr. Tanner, “drops her
portion of leaf in the nest, which is taken up as
required by the small workers, and carried to a clear
space in the nest to be cleaned. This is done with their
mandibles, and if considered too large, it is cut into
smaller pieces. It is then taken in hand by the larger
workers, who lick it with their tongues. Then comes the
most important part, which is almost always done by the
larger workers, who manipulate it between their mandibles,
the ant using her palpi, tongue, three of her legs,
and her antennæ while doing so. It now becomes a small,
almost black ball, varying in size from a mustard-seed to
the finest dust-shot, according to the size of the piece
of leaf that has been manipulated, which varies from ⅛ by
⅛ to ¼ by ¼ of an inch. These balls, really pulp, are then
built on to an edge of the fungus-bed by the larger
workers, and are slightly smoothed down as the work proceeds.
<a id='Page_177'></a>The new surface is then planted by the smaller
workers with slips of the fungus brought from the older
part of the nest. Each plant is planted separately, and
they know exactly how far apart the plants should be. It
sometimes looks as if the plants had been put in too
scantily in places, yet in about forty hours, if the humidity
is regulated, it is all evenly covered with a mantle as if
of very fine snow. It is this fungus they eat, and with
small portions of it the workers feed the larvæ.”</p>

<p class='c017'>The statement herein contained that the ants plant the
new portion of their mushroom-bed with slips or plants
taken from the already growing fungus is, as far as I
know, new. I do not remember it in Herr Möller’s
paper,<a id='r62'></a><a href='#f62' class='c016'><sup>[62]</sup></a> who speaks of the <i><span lang="la">hyphæ</span></i> of the fungus growing
through and round the little leaf-balls within a few
hours, but without reference to their being planted,
nor is it alluded to by Professor Wheeler, who has
studied the mushroom-growing ant—whether the same or
a similar species I know not—in Texas. Forel, again,
speaking of an allied form in Colombia, says, “The largest
workers triturate the leaves”; and again, “the medium-sized
workers of the minim caste are for ever clipping the
threads of the fungus, which then develops the ‘Kohlrabi’
(the little round swellings, that is to say), on which the
ants feed.”<a href='#f62' class='c016'><sup>[62]</sup></a> Possibly this last may allude to the planting,
but if so, it is the reverse of clearly put. Professor
Wheeler also alludes to this constant clipping of the
fungus, and sees in it the probable cause of the mutilation
<a id='Page_178'></a>of the antennæ of the little blind cockroaches that live
with these ants and take toll of their mushrooms.<a id='r63'></a><a href='#f63' class='c016'><sup>[63]</sup></a> But
as these constitute the sole food of their insect cultivators,
it is natural that the latter should frequently clip in order
to eat them, and the clipping would, no doubt, stimulate
their growth. All this, however, is different from the
actual deliberate planting of the fungus on newly laid-down
portions of the bed—an act which would imply a
very clear intention, and make the ants farmers in the
same way that we are. This, however, need not be
the case if they only lay down the beds, for these at one
time probably constituted their actual food, the crop
of fungus being merely incidental. But if the ants
deliberately plant the fungus, then, indeed, they must
know precisely, in a human way, what they are about.</p>

<p class='c017'>As we have seen, the leaves, from which, in their state
of pulp, the mushrooms spring, are stored up by the ants
in large underground chambers; but these mushroom-beds,
or gardens, as they are often called, are themselves a
sort of nest, containing tunnels and chambers, and not
merely unformed heaps. It is in one or other of these
chambers that the queen ant of the nest resides, a majestic
creature, almost an inch long, but inflated both with pride
and eggs to a disproportionate extent. Her sons and
virgin daughters, who will some day be queens themselves,
keep her company, whilst all about in the galleries and
all over the broad, flat surface of the garden, which
resembles a large flattened sponge, walk the different
castes of workers, some large, some small, some medium-sized,
with a few big-headed soldiers here and there
<a id='Page_179'></a>amongst them, as though to keep the crowd in order.
Whether they have really any such duty assigned them we
do not know, but they do not appear to do any work,
whilst the others are all busy at something, and the
smaller workers particularly keep threading the stalks
and filaments of the fungus in order to weed out any
extraneous useless growth from amongst it.<a href='#f63' class='c016'><sup>[63]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c017'>It is a sad reflection—thus sighs Professor Wheeler—that
so much ordered energy, such apparent intelligence,
should all be really due to—<i>what</i> he does not seem to be
quite certain about, not automatism entirely perhaps, but
if not, then semi- or demi-semi-automatism, tempered with
“psychic plasticity.” Against this view of the matter we
have that of Belt, who, after giving two instances, which
came under his own observation, of intelligent adaptation,
on the part of ants, to meet particular circumstances,
exclaims, “Can it be contended that such insects are not
able to determine by reasoning powers which is the best
way of doing a thing, or that their actions are not guided
by thought and reflection?”<a id='r64'></a><a href='#f64' class='c016'><sup>[64]</sup></a> But then Belt was not
provided with the term “psychic plasticity,” and without
it he could only infer intelligence from any intelligent
act.</p>

<p class='c017'>Still it cannot be denied that a great many instances
have been given—noticeably in the case of “<i>our</i> ants” by
Sir John Lubbock<a id='r65'></a><a href='#f65' class='c016'><sup>[65]</sup></a>—in which these paragons of insects
have behaved very stupidly, or shall we say—for why
should a creature that cannot be intelligent be stupid
either?—with great “psychic <i>rigidity</i>”? Certainly such
contradictions are very puzzling, but I would suggest one
<a id='Page_180'></a>way of trying to estimate better the rigid type of ant
intellect, which I believe to be absolutely new, and that
is to compare it not with one’s own brain—or Darwin’s—but
with that of a rigid type of person. It is wonderful
what a difference this might make in our conclusions. An
ant, for instance, that is unable, under some special
circumstances, to get a thing down into its nest, because
it persists in holding or pulling it, in the way it has
always been accustomed to, or another that would rather
be blown into the water along a known road than leave it
for a new one, makes a poor figure in presence of the
seven sages, or amidst a circle of senior wranglers mentally
called up for its confusion; but we should think, rather, of
some pin-headed servant-maid, setting an article of furniture
each morning in the place that, with evident intention,
you have removed it from overnight, or making
up a larger and larger fire as the weather gets warmer and
warmer. One should think of the obstinacy with which
many people cling to old habits which changed times have
made useless, or even harmful, and of how numbers not
only prefer inferior things they are used to, to the most
decisive improvements, but hate and revile such improvements
as though they were undeniable evils. Instances
will occur to everyone. I would rather not mention any
for fear of alienating nine out of every ten of my readers.
We should think, also, of savages or primitive, slow-moving
peoples. What a great unadaptability, for instance,
did the Matabele show in their methods of encountering
our countrymen during the war, and throughout the
rising; as also in that rising itself, since it was against all
<a id='Page_181'></a>those well-known blessings which our empire confers upon
savages.<a id='r66'></a><a href='#f66' class='c016'><sup>[66]</sup></a> It is to these less exalted levels of human faculty
that we should look when we seek to compare an ant’s
mind—when out of its usual set track—with our own, if
we wish to do the ant any justice. That we pursue an
opposite plan is my own explanation of many a partial
verdict. To every experimenter in these directions (who
should happen to ask my advice) I would say, first, “Do
you know, or have you ever known, a really silly person?”
and on his beginning, at once, with “Yes, Mrs.” or
“Miss” (as the case may be), I would strike in peremptorily
thus: “Then keep <i>her</i>—not Newton—in your
mind as a standard of comparison.”</p>

<p class='c017'>That ants should intentionally cultivate mushrooms
will appear wonderful to everybody, and some will see in
it the high-water mark of their mental development, by
whatever path it has been arrived at. It seems natural to
connect such doings with the fact that “in ants the cerebral
ganglia are of extraordinary dimensions, and in all
the Hymenoptera these ganglia are many times larger
than in the less intelligent orders, such as beetles.”<a id='r67'></a><a href='#f67' class='c016'><sup>[67]</sup></a>
Yet the brain of an ant—“one of the most marvellous
atoms of matter in the world, perhaps more so than the
brain of a man”—is “not so large as the quarter of a
small pin’s head.”<a href='#f67' class='c016'><sup>[67]</sup></a> Of what size, then, can a beetle’s be?—especially
that family of beetles which grow and cultivate
mushrooms, just in the same way that ants do. It would
be suggestive—though I hardly know of what—should it
<a id='Page_182'></a>be found that, comparatively speaking, <i>they</i> have no brain
at all.</p>

<p class='c017'>The beetles alluded to have been named, with reference
to the particular kind of mushrooms they grow, ambrosia
beetles, though in what the great superiority of these
over those raised by the ants lies I do not know, for
no one appears to have tasted them. It has been agreed,
however, to call them ambrosia. “One of the most
remarkable facts,” says Mr. Froggatt, “is that each group
of these beetles is associated with a certain kind of
ambrosia or fungus, notwithstanding that they are found
in different timbers. This substance is actually cultivated
by the mother beetle upon a carefully prepared layer
or bed of wood-débris, generally at the end of the
gallery; but in others the ambrosia is grown only in
certain brood chambers of peculiar construction, whilst
in others again it is propagated in beds near the cradles
of the larvæ!”<a id='r68'></a><a href='#f68' class='c016'><sup>[68]</sup></a> When the latter hatch, they find a
supply of celestial food awaiting them, and can walk
about the various galleries, feeding upon it to their hearts’
content.</p>

<p class='c017'>In other cases, however—that is to say, with other
species—social development has gone further, and, besides
boring galleries, the mother-beetle excavates a number of
cells in their walls, like rows of bedrooms opening out
of either side of a passage. She does not, however, quite
finish her bedrooms, but, whilst they are still incomplete,
lays an egg in each, and when this hatches, the young
beetle, then in its larval state, takes up the task where she
left off, and in time completes it. All the while they are
<a id='Page_183'></a>growing up the mother feeds the young ones, and, between
the intervals of doing so, stops up the entrance
to the cell with a “plug”—such is the word employed;
“to what base uses we may return, Horatio!”—of ambrosia.
In time, when they have acquired the full imago form,
each female beetle flies away to make a burrow and rear
a family of her own, and in some species she is accompanied
in this marriage flight, as it may be called, by the
male. In others, however, the males are wingless, and
remain in the burrow, till, when their appointed time
comes, they die. Whether the male, when winged, assists
the female in her mining operations I am not quite sure,
inasmuch as that point seems to be avoided in the
accounts which I have been able to consult, but the wingless
male would not be able to do so, as he would be left
behind in the burrow when the female flew away to found
another colony.</p>

<p class='c017'>The fungus, when it has once commenced to grow,
increases very rapidly, so that if the number of beetles in
the nest is much diminished, as, say, by some accident,
the rest cannot eat enough to keep it down, and so,
it would appear, are suffocated. It is asserted, however,
that when the wingless males are deserted by the females,
and would otherwise perish in this way, they all collect
together in a few of the galleries and feast on the
ambrosia there growing. By this means, we are told,
they “prolong for a time their useless existence”—an ungrateful
way of putting it, so it seems to me, as the poor
things have already been useful in a very indispensable
manner, so that their existence as a whole is anything but
<a id='Page_184'></a>useless, and to separate a part of it from the rest and
carp at that is silly as well as ill-natured. But it is
the fashion to speak in this harsh way of the male insect,
beginning with the drone bee; whereas when the female
has done all that <i>she</i> can do—which is often just to lay
her eggs—nobody talks of <i>her</i> useless existence. Fashion
is a curious thing, and ants, even if they be automatons,
are not the only creatures that do things automatically.</p>

<p class='c017'>It is certainly very curious, if it be true, that the wingless
male beetles should, by thus congregating together
in this way, and so saving their lives, show more intelligence
than the winged females, who, under similar
circumstances, are choked with their ambrosia, as the
Duke of Clarence was with his nectar in a malmsey-butt.
It is true that with the males the thing happens every
year, whereas with the females it is only accidental; but,
in the particular circumstances, it is difficult to see how
inheritance can have had anything to do with it. Here,
then, are a particular family of beetles who live the same
sort of social life that ants and bees do, which discovery
appears to have been made by a Mr. Hubbard not so many
years ago, and from whose paper on the subject all
the above particulars have been taken, though only
through the medium of various magazines, since even
at the British Museum I was unable to get the paper
itself. So long ago, however, as 1844 a certain Herr
Theo Hartig “published an article on the ambrosia of
<i><span lang="la">Xyleborno (Bostrichus) dispar</span></i>, in which he showed that it
was a fungus growth (<i><span lang="de">pilzrasen</span></i>), and he named the fungus
<i><span lang="la">Monilia candida</span></i>.” This statement is made by Mr.
<a id='Page_185'></a>Hubbard in his much more recent account. Not feeling
perfectly certain from it whether the origin, as well as
the nature, of the strange-named substance was not also
divined by the German investigator, I quote the reference
in order not to do him a possible injustice, for to me
it seems that there have been few more interesting discoveries
than this of these ant-like, ambrosia-growing
beetles. But why the ants only grow mushrooms, thus
allowing themselves to be enormously outdone by an
inferior insect, is more than I can understand.</p>

<p class='c017'>And now a word of justice to these beetles. It might
be supposed that, by burrowing into trees, they caused the
death of the latter, but this is not really the case. Writing
in <i>The Agricultural Gazette</i> of New South Wales for
August, 1900, Mr. Froggatt, the Government Entomologist,
makes the following statement absolving <i><span lang="la">Xleborus</span></i>:
“This curious little beetle (<i><span lang="la">X. solidus</span></i>) is rather plentiful
about Sydney, and is frequently sent to us taken out
of the trunks of fruit trees, which it is supposed to have
killed; but in all cases that have come under my notice it
has had nothing to do with the tree dying, but is attracted
to the tree as soon as it becomes sick, the bark begins
to wither, and the first symptoms of decay set in.” Mr.
Froggatt adds: “The instinct that leads these and other
wood-boring beetles to a tree as soon as it is sick is something
marvellous; in the tropics I have collected many
fine, rare species upon the freshly cut tent-poles in our
camp, attracted to the wood, but otherwise seldom found
in the bush.” This instinct would seem to be a remarkably
developed scent, though why a severed branch should
<a id='Page_186'></a>smell differently from the tree of which it but a moment
before made a part it is not easy to imagine. However,
we cannot, without evidence, attribute clairvoyance to
beetles, and perhaps it is the cut from which the scent
emanates.</p>

<p class='c017'>Another example of an insect which is neither an ant,
bee, wasp, nor white ant, but which yet may be said to live
a true social life, is the little creature which, under the
name of <i><span lang="la">Psocus venosus</span></i> and as belonging to the order
<i><span lang="la">Carrodentia</span></i>, will be familiar to everyone. It is nearly
related to the so-called book-lice, but lives in the open air,
“being seen,” says Mr. Leland Howard, “upon the trunks
of trees, in flocks numbering from twelve to forty or fifty
individuals.”<a id='r69'></a><a href='#f69' class='c016'><sup>[69]</sup></a> These browse together like a herd of miniature
cattle on the various lichens that embrace the bark,
and these they nibble so closely that wherever they move
they leave a bare track behind them. Sometimes one
family and sometimes several are included in the herd, all
ages and stages being represented, from the wingless but
free-moving larvæ to the winged imago form. The latter,
however, though they be thus provided, will not readily
forsake their young, but the whole of them, when alarmed,
first run all together, and then, if the cause of disquietude
continue, suddenly scatter as though in panic, and run
hither and thither, in all and every direction. When the
danger seems over, they close up their ranks again, and go
on browsing as before.</p>

<p class='c017'>The female <i><span lang="la">Psocus</span></i> lays her eggs in little clusters of
from fifteen to twenty, and protects each cluster under
a sort of dome or shield of gnawed wood which she presses
<a id='Page_187'></a>upon them so that they stick to it. She is said to brood
over the eggs, but this does not appear to mean that she
actually incubates them. Rather, she remains about,
keeping watchful guard till they are hatched, and then
takes the young to find pasture, walking at their head like
a hen in front of her chickens. From such beginnings as
these it seems possible that the social life of ants has been,
in the course of ages, evolved and developed.</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_0_4 c015'>IT is, no doubt, through feeding on wood that the
beetles we have been considering came in time to feed
on ambrosia. The particular fungus, that is to say,
which for some unaccountable reason has received this
name, appeared as a natural growth upon the walls of
their tunnels, and in time it came to be thought necessary,
and its coming was arranged for. By similar steps, probably,
the leaves once carried as food to their nests by the
sauba ants, or cooshies, have become the soil merely on
which that food is grown; and so I have no doubt
myself that even if the present agricultural ants of Texas
do not purposely sow and afterwards reap the rice that
springs up around the circular mound of their domicile,
their descendants will do so. Indeed, it seems rather
curious that, with such facilities for a gradual development,
the habit has not yet been acquired; and this is the
chief reason which inclines me to suspend judgment on
the question, and wait for further observations. Far from
thinking the thing too wonderful, I wonder if it be not
the case. Such wonder, however, is for ants and not for
<a id='Page_189'></a>beetles, except, indeed, ambrosia beetles, who certainly
merit it, though in an opposite way. No other wood-borers
of the order are anything but wood-eaters, or,
at any rate, if a few feed on fungus, as would not be
improbable, should it happen to appear, they have
nothing to do with the cultivation of it. The words “as
far as we know,” however, must be added to the foregoing
statement. Numbers of beetles pass the larval and pupal
stage of their existence within the trunk of a decaying or
even of a perfectly sound tree, from which they issue after
the final metamorphosis has been made. Amongst these
is our own stag-beetle, in whom, that is to say in whose
caterpillar, some suppose themselves to see the <i><span lang="la">Cossus</span></i> of
the ancient Romans, which was as much appreciated by
them, and, no doubt, justly, as are earthworms by the
Chinese. Others, however, believe this to have been the
large red meaty-looking caterpillar of the goat-moth; and
as the one conjecture is quite as plausible as the other,
the only, or, at any rate, the best way of arriving at
a conclusion would be to try them both—a simple plan
which, as far as I know, has not yet been adopted.</p>

<p class='c017'>The stag-beetle—when of maximum size, that is to say,
for it varies amazingly in this respect—is much the
largest beetle which this our island possesses, but though,
with its huge, antler-like jaws, it makes a good perennial
illustration for all books of popular entomology, its merits
seem to end there, for either there is nothing or nothing
has yet been observed particularly interesting about it.
No doubt, if we look at the matter from an absolute rather
than a relative point of view, the second of these two
<a id='Page_190'></a>explanations is the correct one, for a creature has only to
be studied in order to become interesting; but as compared
with ants, bees, wasps, and many other insects,
beetles, or, at any rate, the vast majority of them, are not
so very entertaining in their habits, and the stag-beetle
has no superiority in this respect to correspond with its
size and uncommon appearance. This appearance, however,
is confined to the male, who alone possesses the
great branching mandibles on which its greater size also
is largely dependent. It would be natural to suppose
that these formidable weapons, as they certainly appear,
stood in relation to the combats of the males for the
possession of the females, yet it is often stated that the
short, sharp pincers of the latter, which can be made, it
would seem—anyone who doubts may try—to meet in
the flesh, are really the more efficient of the two. Be this
as it may, it is not improbable that the stag-beetle’s jaws,
since they are very handsome, may have been developed
less as weapons than as ornaments, under the laws of sexual
selection. Darwin, if I remember, was doubtfully of this
opinion, and he attributes many strange projections and
processes on the head or thorax of other beetles—as
notably that huge one with a snout like a weaver’s beam,
called the Hercules beetle—to the same agency. No use
for this extraordinary trunk, as one may term it, has as
yet been discovered, but as the under portion is covered
with a thick matting of soft brown hairs, it would seem
as though it had some office to perform, unless indeed we
suppose this <i><span lang="fr">chevelure</span></i> to be likewise admired. A lesser,
though still tremendous, projection, starting from the
<a id='Page_191'></a>head, as the other one does from the thorax, is likewise
unaccounted for, for though the two together make in
appearance a pair of uncouth and irregular pincers, they
neither are, nor apparently can be used in this way.
Nothing appears to be known of this strange creature’s
habits, and the same may be said in regard to most of the
more remarkable-looking beetles of the world, as well as
those which are not so extraordinary in their appearance.
The ways of beetles, in fact, have been but little studied,
and it is perhaps not too much to say that if for every
thousand that fill the show-cases in museums we could
know the life-history of one, we might with infinite
advantage, in exchange for this knowledge, throw the
whole pin-forest of them into the sea. In what light this
fact, if true, exhibits the labours of those naturalists—as
the world calls them—who, living for years amidst the
life-teeming regions of the earth, have spent their whole
time in constantly killing and killing, coming home, at
last, with an acre of carcasses, to write a book containing
hardly anything of first-hand observation—the soul of
natural history—I will not pause to inquire.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>There are many other species of beetles, the males of
which are ornamented about the head and thorax with all
sorts of knobs and projections, so that, with some, one
might think that a one-horned or two-horned rhinoceros
had undergone metempsychosis, as it is called, that its
soul, that is to say, had transmigrated into the body
of an insect, which latter had been fashioned so as fancifully
to resemble its old one. However, as this would be
a downward journey, it is more satisfactory to imagine
<a id='Page_192'></a>that certain beetles have been “translated” into rhinoceroses.
As to these kinds of excrescences, Darwin
believed them to be of the nature of adornments, and
since their owners—the males—have not been seen to use
them in warfare, and indeed do not appear to fight, it
is difficult to imagine any other <i><span lang="fr">raison d’être</span></i> for them.
This seems all the more likely because certain flies found
in the Malay Archipelago have likewise excrescences,
which we have to call horns, and these too are confined to
the males, though it is hardly to be imagined that they
would fight in a manner to make them of service. These
flies must be most extraordinary creatures to look at.
They have long legs, which they draw together underneath
them, so as to stand very high, and their horns are not
only conspicuous by their size and shape, but also by
being brightly coloured. Thus in one species they are
a beautiful pink with a light stripe down the centre, and
bordered on each side with black. In another the colours
are yellow, black, and brown, and though <i>Elaphomia
cervicornis</i> has to be contented with black, and pale tips,
yet his are the finest pair of all, being nearly as long
as his body, and branched so as to look like a pair of
slender and delicate stag’s horns. The other pairs are
not like this, one of them being rather club-shaped, and
therefore less horn-like, whilst another has an extraordinary
resemblance to the antlers of an elk, which are
broad and palmated, so that <i>it</i> is the <i><span lang="la">Elaphomia alcicornis</span></i>.
Here, therefore, are both horned beetles and horned flies
who yet do not fight with their horns, so that unless they
serve as ornaments it would be a puzzle to say what they
<a id='Page_193'></a>do serve as; for as the male beetles do not fight, which is
the principal way in which male creatures, including man,
show their vigour, why should we suppose them to be
more vigorous than the females?</p>

<p class='c017'>In some other beetles, which do fight, the sexes do not
differ conspicuously, nor do their facial or other peculiarities
appear to bear any special relation to warfare. Thus
“those curious little beetles, the <i><span lang="la">Brenthidæ</span></i>” of the
Malay Archipelago, have an extraordinarily long snout—or
rostrum, to talk entomologically—at the end of which
come the jaws and antennæ, and this rostrum is used
by the female to bore holes in decaying wood, where she
afterwards deposits her eggs. The males, however, do
what they can with them as weapons, and Dr. Wallace
has seen two of them fighting together in a very comic
manner. “Each,” he tells us, “had a fore-leg laid across
the neck of the other, and the rostrum bent quite in an
attitude of defiance, and looking most ridiculous.”<a id='r70'></a><a href='#f70' class='c016'><sup>[70]</sup></a> On
another occasion “two were fighting for a female, who
stood close by busy at her boring. They pushed at
each other with their rostra, and clawed and thumped,
apparently in the greatest rage, although their coats of
mail must have saved both from injury. The small one,
however, soon ran away, acknowledging himself vanquished.”<a href='#f70' class='c016'><sup>[70]</sup></a>
<i><span lang="la">Lethrus cephalotes</span></i> is another fighting beetle,
and here the males, instead of horns or anything extraordinary,
have merely somewhat larger mandibles than
the females. “The two sexes,” says Darwin, “inhabit
the same burrow. If, during the breeding season, a
strange male attempts to enter the burrow he is attacked;
<a id='Page_194'></a>the female does not remain passive, but closes the mouth
of the burrow and encourages her mate by continually
pushing him on from behind; and the battle lasts until
the aggressor is killed or runs away.”<a id='r71'></a><a href='#f71' class='c016'><sup>[71]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c017'>Of yet another species, the <i><span lang="la">Ateuchus cicatricosus</span></i>, the
sexes “live in pairs, and seem much attached to each
other; the male excites the female to roll the balls of
dung in which the ova are deposited, and if she is
removed he becomes much agitated. If the male is removed
the female ceases all work, and, as M. Brulerie
believes, would remain on the same spot until she died.”<a id='r72'></a><a href='#f72' class='c016'><sup>[72]</sup></a>
But M. Brulerie was reckoning apparently without M.
Fabre, since whose investigations in this last department
it may be said that “<i><span lang="fr">nous avons changé tout cela</span></i>.” For
this <i><span lang="la">Ateuchus</span></i> is none other than the celebrated Scarabæus,
or sacred beetle, and, in the first place, M. Fabre has
shown that the balls of dung, which are rolled about by
them with so much perseverance and energy, do not contain
the ova, as it was always thought that they did, but
are merely provender and nothing more, and though
sometimes they are rolled by two beetles together,
these are not the male and female, or, at any rate, they
need not be. They are just as likely to be two males or
two females, and in any case, though the two may be of
opposite sexes, they do not represent a mated pair.
Simply when the two—if, as is by no means always the
case, more than one take part in the rolling—have pulled
and pushed the ball to a suitable place, they make a hole
in the ground, into which they drag it, and, having closed
the aperture, sit and feast at their leisure.</p>

<p class='c017'><a id='Page_195'></a>According to Fabre the vital principle contained in the
egg would be destroyed were it rolled about in this
fashion, so when the mother Scarabæus, who, it would
appear, works in this matter alone, is ready to lay her
eggs, she first makes an excavation, and then brings the
dung down into it in pellets, till there is a heap of it,
which fills the whole concern. Then “the first thing to
do is to select very carefully, taking what is most delicate
for the inner layers, upon which the larva will feed, and
the coarser for the outer ones, which merely serve as a
protecting shell. There around a central hollow which
receives the egg the materials must be arranged layer
after layer, according to their decreasing fineness and
nutritive value; the strata must be made consistent, and
adhere one to another; and finally the bits of fibre in the
outside crust, which has to protect the whole thing, must
be felted together.”<a id='r73'></a><a href='#f73' class='c016'><sup>[73]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c017'>Thus, when the grub first issues from the egg, it finds
light digestible food ready to hand, which becomes
coarser and more fibrous with its growth and increased
capacity of assimilating such stronger diet. As more and
more is eaten, the ball, which is about the size of an ordinary
apple, becomes hollower and hollower, till at last,
when only the outer crust remains, the grub is ready to
enter upon that wonderful series of changes—called its
metamorphoses—which will bring it forth into this larger
ball of dirt, a complete beetle, with a useful profession,
that of scavenger, immediately open to it.</p>

<p class='c017'>Thus a fallacy which, according to Fabre, dates from
the time of the Pharaohs, viz. that every ball of dung
<a id='Page_196'></a>which one might at any time see a Scarabæus beetle rolling
and trundling along contained its egg, has been
finally disposed of, nor is this the only one. It used to be
thought, not only that any two beetles rolling a ball
between them were male and female, but also that any
single one that happened to be in difficulties would immediately
fly off and summon a comrade or two to its aid.
Fabre denies this altogether, and maintains that in this
rolling away of provisions each individual beetle is purely
a self-seeker. It is true, as we have seen, that the <i>bonne
bouche</i> will often be eaten by two Scarabæi—never more—in
the cavern prepared beforehand for its reception, but,
according to Fabre, this is only because it is to the mutual
interest of both to act in this way, since neither can succeed
in appropriating the ball to itself, in spite of efforts—which
in other cases, however, may be successful—to do so.</p>

<p class='c017'>In all such cases the one beetle is the real owner of the
ball, whilst the other is only there with the intention of
stealing it if he can. Thus the thief will often let himself
be pushed along by the honest worker, lying flat on
the ball, and doing no work whatever, though at other
times, when a rise in the ground makes it difficult for a
single beetle to roll it, he will assist with all his power.
Again, whilst the one Scarabæus is hollowing out a cave
for the approaching banquet to take place in, the other,
left with the ball, will, after some time, begin to go off
with it alone, and unless pursued by the owner before he
has gone too far, he accomplishes his purpose, and eats it
all himself. Thus he has associated himself to the maker
of the ball with the distinct idea of stealing it if he can.
<a id='Page_197'></a>He has this plot in his mind, to pretend partnership, to
even give real assistance, but to watch his opportunity and
decamp when it occurs. That, at least, is the view suggested
for our adoption, but I cannot say that it recommends
itself to me. Fabre, in my opinion, has disposed
of one error only to fall into another of precisely the
same kind. He says very justly in regard to the idea
that one beetle would deliberately fly away and summon
others to its assistance, “It is no slight thing to admit
that an insect has a truly surprising grasp of the situation,
and a facility for communicating its ideas to others
of its kind more surprising still. Are we to suppose that
a Scarabæus in distress conceives the idea of begging for
help, flies off, explores the country round, etc.?” Very
true; but if we are not to suppose this, I certainly will
not suppose, either, that this same Scarabæus can conceive
the idea of pretending to assist another in order to rob
him of his property. This would be as deep a laid scheme
as the other, and the facts of the case, as given by Fabre
himself, do not appear to me to lend themselves to such
an explanation.</p>

<p class='c017'>The point of these interesting relations has been, in
my opinion, entirely missed. What we really see in
them, or what, at least, is there for us to see, is the
beginnings of order and social polity, evolving themselves
out of lawlessness and the strong hand. Further,
it has already gone some little way, for the fact that two
Scarabæi do, as a matter of fact, assist each other very
materially in rolling the ball, and that they do sit and
eat it together in the same chamber, are not to be got
<a id='Page_198'></a>over by any such amusing fancy picture as this brilliant
writer, as well as keen observer, has given us. It is no
use fixing our eyes upon that part of the conduct of the
beetle which we are invited to call the thief, in contradistinction
to the owner—I doubt myself if Fabre has
always kept the two distinct from beginning to end—if
we pass over the other and much more interesting parts
of it. Why does this beetle help to get the ball up a
hill, and why does he sit for some considerable time with
it outside the cave that the other is making, before he
begins to go off with it? Does he say to himself, in the
first case, “If we don’t get it to the right place, to begin
with, he’ll never dig a hole and leave me outside with
it,” and, in the second, “I’ll wait till he has come out
and found it all right, several times, so that his suspicions
may be put to sleep”? This would be scheming with a
vengeance; but <i><span lang="fr">serviteur Monsieur Fabre</span></i>, I must refer you
to your own incredulity in another matter. I will never
accept such an explanation, and the view which I take of
the whole affair is this. The beetle which Fabre calls the
thief is under the sway probably of precisely the same
feeling as the other one—the rightful owner. He has
seized a piece of dung, and as he seizes it, whether
another has it at the time or not, it appears to be his,
that being the only idea of rightful ownership which is
not too large for his comprehension. Finding, however,
that another beetle has exactly the same idea as himself,
he is forced, willy nilly—and the experience is being
constantly repeated—to accommodate himself to this
circumstance and make the best of it. The ball—this
<a id='Page_199'></a>is the one great advantage—will continue to roll even if
he does not push it. Therefore he can afford to be lazy
sometimes, and be pushed along with it. The ball stops:
in that case he must push it, and, even without this
incentive, it would appear from Fabre’s account that the
two often work together. Thus, from the very necessities
of the case, it is evident that a sense of partnership—at
least a feeling of doing work in combination with another—has
begun to dawn in the mind of the Scarabæus. The
fact that when the one beetle is left alone with the ball,
whilst the other excavates, it does not immediately go
off, but stays a little, as though waiting to be rejoined,
suggests to my mind that this feeling, fostered by custom,
has already gone some way, though it is not wonderful
that, after a time, the primitive individualistic tendency
should again assert itself. But when the fugitive is overtaken,
it assists the other to roll the ball back, and the
end of it all is a meal shared peacefully between the two,
in one common apartment. If we suppose that the instinct,
or capacity, of working together for some common
end has had any beginning, surely we might expect to
find it in some such state of affairs as this. The result
of primitive conceptions is that two Scarabæi are often
obliged to roll one ball between them, and if there be
any advantage in this arrangement, natural selection will
no doubt do the rest. That it has already begun to do it is,
I think, very probable; but Fabre was not an evolutionist.</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_4_0_4 c015'>MUSHROOM-GROWING, especially if the ants plant
the mushrooms in the way stated by Mr. Tanner,
is just as extraordinary, I think, as their habit of
planting a field with ant-rice and reaping it at the
proper time would be, did they really practise it. Up to
a little while ago it certainly seemed as though they did,
for there was Dr. Lincecum’s definite statement based upon
twelve years’ observation, and this, if not confirmed by
Mr. McCook, was, at any rate, not contradicted by him.
On the contrary, McCook mentioned a good many facts
pointing in the direction of Lincecum’s assertion, and
though he did not consider them decisive, he could see no
reason why the ants should not act in this way, as indeed
there is none: so that as he had only stayed a few months
where Lincecum had lived for twelve years, he seemed like
a weaker witness supporting, according to his opportunities
of observation, a much stronger one. Now, however,
comes another witness, whose opportunities have also been
great, and in a somewhat heavy-handed way, in a spirit of
<a id='Page_201'></a>myth-slaying and irrelevant reference to supposed schoolboy
knowledge, hardly required in face of all that ants are
known to do, denies the whole thing.</p>

<p class='c017'>First, however, let us have the assertion as originally
made by Lincecum, which is, that on the summit of the
mound of their nests, from which they carefully clear
away all other vegetation, the harvesting ants sow the
seed of a certain plant called ant-rice for the purpose of
subsequently reaping a harvest of the grain. It is sown
in time for the autumnal rains to bring up, and at the
beginning of November a green row or ring of ant-rice,
about four inches wide, is seen springing up round the
circumference of the <i>disk</i> (as the circular top of the
mound is, for some reason, always called). In the vicinity
of this circular ring the ants do not permit a single
spire of any other grass or weed to remain a day, but
leave the aristida or ant-rice untouched until it ripens,
which occurs in June of the next year. After the maturing
and harvesting of the seed, the dry stubble is cut
away and removed from the disk, which is thus left unencumbered
until the ensuing autumn, when the same species
of grass again appears as before, and so on.<a id='r74'></a><a href='#f74' class='c016'><sup>[74]</sup></a> After
stating in a letter to Darwin that he has seen all this
taking place year after year, Dr. Lincecum adds:—“There
can be no doubt of the fact that the particular species of
grain-bearing grass mentioned above is intentionally
planted. In farmer-like manner the ground upon which
it stands is carefully divested of all other grasses and
weeds during the time it is growing. When it is ripe the
grain is taken care of, the dry stubble cut away and
<a id='Page_202'></a>carried off, the paved area being left unencumbered until
the ensuing autumn, when the same ant-rice reappears
within the same circle and receives the same agricultural
attention as was bestowed upon the previous crop, and so
on year after year, as I <i>know</i> to be the case in all situations
where the ants’ settlements are protected from
graminivorous animals.”<a id='r75'></a><a href='#f75' class='c016'><sup>[75]</sup></a> Lincecum also believed that
the ants were able in some way to prevent the seed stored
in their nests from germinating. This same fact has been
asserted, and apparently proved, by Moggridge, in regard
to the harvesting ant of southern Europe, and he also
states that, if in spite of the precaution any seeds begin
to sprout, the ants by gnawing off the tips of the radicles
would prevent the germination from proceeding.</p>

<p class='c017'>This, then, is the case <i>for</i> the harvesting ant, as we may
say; for if these things be true they are certainly much
to its credit, whereas, if not, the scandal is so great that
it ought to change its name. Let us now hear the case
against, as stated by Professor Wheeler, after which
readers may make up their minds, if they can, for I have
not quite done so yet. I quote in full, so that the two
statements may be balanced against each other, and
this, I hope, will be more interesting than the usual
“Mr. So and So, however, disputes this and thinks,
etc.”—another line or two in which the contrary proposition
of the one before is stated at about the same length.
This is what Professor Wheeler, who “speaks home—you
may relish him more (or at least as much) in the
soldier as the scholar”—has to say: “It may not be
altogether out of place in this paper to record a few
<a id='Page_203'></a>other observations on <i><span lang="la">Pogonomyrmex molifacieus</span></i>, inasmuch
as this form has been singled out among all the known
members of the genus as presenting certain remarkable
instincts. Lincecum is responsible for the myth that
this <i><span lang="la">Pogonomyrmex</span></i> sows a certain species of grass, the
‘ant-rice’ (<i><span lang="la">Aristida oligantha</span></i>), protects it from harm
and frees it from weeds while it is growing, for the
purpose of reaping the grain. This notion, which even
the Texan schoolboy (not Macaulay’s, who probably
knew as much about it) has come to regard as a joke,
has been widely cited, largely because the great Darwin
stood sponsor for its publication in the Journal of the
Linnean Society. McCook, after spending a few weeks
in Texas observing the ant in question and recording
his observations in a book of 310 pages, failed to obtain
any evidence either for or against the Lincecum myth
and merely succeeded in extending its vogue by admitting
its plausibility. Two years of nearly continuous
observation enable me to suggest the probable source
of Lincecum’s and McCook’s misconceptions. In either
case the observer has started with a few facts, and has
then stopped short to draw inferences before gathering
more facts. If the nests of <i><span lang="la">Molifacieus</span></i> be studied during
the cool winter months—and this is the only time to study
them leisurely and comfortably, since the cold subdues the
fiery stings of their inhabitants—the seeds which the ants
have garnered in many of their chambers will often be
found to have sprouted. It is, therefore, certain that
these ants are not able to prevent the seed from germinating,
as Moggridge claims for the European species of
<a id='Page_204'></a>Messar, except by conveying them to drier chambers; and
in protracted spells of wet weather even this precaution
seems to be of no avail. On sunny days the ants may
often be seen removing these seeds when they have
sprouted too far to be left for food, and carrying them to
the refuse heap, which is always at the extremity of the
cleared earthern disk or mound. In this place the seeds
thus cast away as inedible often take root, and, somewhat
later, form an arc of tall grass more or less closely
approximating to a complete circle round the nest. Since
these ants feed largely, though by no means exclusively, on
grass-seeds, and since these particular seeds are a very
common and favourite article of food, it is easy to see how
their grass should often predominate in the circle. In
reality, however, only a small percentage of the nests, and
only those situated in certain localities, present such circles.
Now to state that the ant, like a provident farmer, sows this
cereal, and guards and weeds it for the sake of garnering
its grain, is as absurd as to say that the family cook is
planting and maintaining an orchard when some of the
peach-stones which she has carelessly thrown into the
backyard, with the other kitchen refuse, chance to grow
into peach trees.”<a href='#f75' class='c016'><sup>[75]</sup></a> Certainly such a thing should have
been observed before the statement was made, and, if
it has not been, the facts seem more probably accounted
for on the above explanation.</p>

<p class='c017'>Professor Wheeler goes on to say that “there are several
other facts which show that the special ring of grass
about the nest is an unintentional and inconstant result
of the activities of the ant colony. For instance, one
<a id='Page_205'></a>often finds very flourishing ant-colonies that have existed
for years in the midst of much-travelled roads, or in stone
side-walls, often a hundred or more feet from any vegetation
whatever (without any ant-rice on their mounds
therefore). Again, it is very evident that even a complete
circle of grass like those described by Lincecum and
McCook would be entirely inadequate to supply more
than a very small fraction of the grain necessary for the
support of a flourishing colony of these ants. Hence they
are always obliged to make long trips into the surrounding
vegetation, and thereby wear out regular paths, which
radiate in different directions, often to a distance of forty
to sixty feet from the entrance of the nest. The existence
of these paths, which are often found in connection with
grass-encircled nests, is alone sufficient to disprove Lincecum’s
statements.”<a href='#f75' class='c016'><sup>[75]</sup></a> It certainly seems easier to suppose
that Lincecum misinterpreted certain facts, not themselves
in dispute, than that an explanation on which so many
considerations seem to throw doubt is the correct one.
One thing, at least, seems certain—if some of these ant
communities grow grain of set purpose, all of them do
not. This may be possible, but more proof of it than
Lincecum has brought is demanded. If the ants really
sow and reap the grain that grows upon their mounds,
and, more especially, if they carefully keep the patch
clear, it ought not to be difficult to see them doing so.
This last would be decisive, whereas the other two are
by no means so.</p>

<p class='c017'>That ants should use their own larvæ like a shuttle, and
for the same purpose, seems as strange a thing as one can
<a id='Page_206'></a>well imagine, but there is no doubt at all about it, the
act having been witnessed on various occasions by competent
observers, whose evidence is mutually corroborated.
The species in question is common in Eastern Asia, and is
accustomed to make little houses or arbours for itself by
bending leaves round so that the edges meet, and then
fixing them together, as some caterpillars do. Now the
larva can do something which the grown ant cannot, which
is to spin a cocoon from a sort of gummy, thread-like
substance which issues from the mouth. Whilst one
group of ants therefore join to keep the leaf bent in the
proper position, another take each a larva in their jaws,
and pass it from edge to edge of the leaf, applying its
mouth to each edge, until the two are bound firmly
together.<a id='r76'></a><a href='#f76' class='c016'><sup>[76]</sup></a> Whether this is a more or less remarkable
habit than growing mushrooms it would be difficult, perhaps,
to decide, nor is there any need to try, since such
questions are more interesting left uncertain.</p>

<p class='c017'>It is well known, or at least credibly asserted, that ants
cross rivers by clinging one to another from the branch of
a tree overhanging the water, till the end of this living
chain, as it becomes longer and longer, is carried by the
force of the current to the opposite bank, where a
bridge is formed, over which the main body marches.<a id='r77'></a><a href='#f77' class='c016'><sup>[77]</sup></a>
According to Du Chaillu the ants in Africa make, not
only a bridge, but a tunnel—“a high, safe tubular bridge
through which the whole vast regiment marches in regular
order.”<a id='r78'></a><a href='#f78' class='c016'><sup>[78]</sup></a> These are the celebrated driver or bashikouay
ants, who, when upon their terrible marauding marches,
put every living creature, including man, to flight, though
<a id='Page_207'></a>for many flight is in vain. Size and strength are here no
protection. “The elephant and gorilla fly before them;
the black men run for their lives.” So says Du Chaillu,
and, sure enough, when the skins of some of the poor
gorillas he shot arrived in England, several of these ants
were found amongst the hair.<a id='r79'></a><a href='#f79' class='c016'><sup>[79]</sup></a> In the forests of equatorial
Africa, abounding—if they have not all been shot by this
time—with large animals, these hunting-raids must give
rise to some stirring scenes. What crashings through the
trees and undergrowth! What uncouth sounds, perhaps,
of mingled pain and rage! How a bitten gorilla would
express himself! What a subject for a picture if a herd
of elephants, a few families of gorillas, a score or so
of lions, with a few leopards, and baboons, perhaps a
rhinoceros, and any number of antelopes, were all to come
rushing down together to where an artist stood ready for
them! I should like to see the picture he would draw.</p>

<p class='c017'>A more remarkable sight even than an ant-bridge is
perhaps an ant-nest, by which I mean, not an ants’ nest
in the ordinary sense of the term, but a nest made of ants.
The following quotation from the much-containing <i>Naturalist
in Nicaragua</i>, page 25, will explain this hard saying.
“They make their temporary habitations in hollow trees,
and sometimes underneath large fallen trunks that offer
suitable hollows. A nest that I came across in the latter
situation was open at one side. The ants were clustered
together in a dense mass like a great swarm of bees
hanging from the roof, but reaching to the ground below.
Their innumerable long legs looked like brown threads
binding together the mass, which must have been at
<a id='Page_208'></a>least a cubic yard in bulk, and contained hundreds of
thousands of individuals, although many columns were
outside, some bringing in the pupæ of ants, others the
legs and dissected bodies of various insects. I was
surprised to see in this living nest tubular passages leading
down to the centre of the mass, kept open just as if
it had been formed of inorganic materials. Down these
holes the ants who were bringing in booty passed with
their prey.” Of the many curiously constructed or
strangely produced dwellings of ants, this made out of
their own bodies is amongst the most remarkable.</p>

<p class='c017'>Many ants live in the interior of various plants. The
plant generally benefits as much as the insect by this
arrangement, so that there is a mutual dependence between
the two, which in some cases is carried to such an extent
that the life of one or both seems a necessary part of that
of the other. In Borneo, for instance, a certain large
tuber which grows on the branches of aged trees is always
found inhabited by a certain red ant, of small size, but
fierce disposition, which rushes out and attacks anyone
who ventures at all near its dwelling. The seed of this
tuber is disseminated in the same way as is our own
mistletoe, through the agency of birds, that is to say, the
seed being surrounded by a similar pulpy mass, which
adheres to the branch on which it falls. Soon after
germination the tuber, which is shaped something like
a carrot, begins to develop, but whilst still quite small its
growth ceases and in this state it would remain, and
before long, die, if it should not happen to be found by
the ants in question. If it should be, however, its life is
<a id='Page_209'></a>assured. They immediately bore a hole at the base of the
stem, upon which this enlarges to a great degree, so that
soon there is room for them to excavate galleries in the
cellular tissue of the interior, and to form a populous
colony. The whole tuber is soon perforated in all
directions, and becomes a living and growing formicarium,
the great accretion of cellular tissue which has made this
possible having been caused by the poison—if we may
call it so—of the ant’s bite, in the same way as the sting
of the gall-fly raises galls upon the oak.<a id='r80'></a><a href='#f80' class='c016'><sup>[80]</sup></a> Of course, from
the moment that the ants appear the tuber is safe from
any other insect, or small bird, or mammal that might
otherwise do it harm. The ants in defending their nest
would defend it, and it is on this principle of mutual
advantage that such ant and plant alliances have been
brought about.</p>

<p class='c017'>Thus the dry, arid plains, called savannahs, of tropical
America support a species of acacia of which the thorns,
characteristic of the family, grow in pairs and are shaped
exactly like the horns of some oxen. Every pair of these
horns becomes in time an ants’ nest, and if the tree be
touched or shaken, the ants rush out full of fury in
defence of their habitations. Thus every tree is tenanted
by a large army of retainers, who almost more than the
thorns themselves, which have been developed for the
same purpose, protect it against browsing quadrupeds.
Its thorns, however, would be no protection against the
leaf-cutting ants in search of materials for their mushroom-beds,
whereas these are kept at bay by a hostile species,
smaller indeed, but armed with a powerful sting. “For
<a id='Page_210'></a>these services,” says Belt, “the ants are not only securely
housed by the plant, but are provided with a bountiful
supply of food; and to secure their attendance at the
right time and place, this food is so arranged and distributed
as to effect that object with wonderful perfection.
The leaves are bi-pinnate (double, that is to say), and
at the base of each pair of leaflets, on the mid-rib, is
a crater-formed gland, which, when the leaves are young,
secretes a honey-like liquid. Of this the ants are very
fond; and they are constantly running about from one
gland to another to sip up the honey as it is secreted.
But this is not all; there is a still more wonderful provision
of solid food. At the end of each of the small
divisions of the compound leaflet there is, when the leaf
first unfolds, a little yellow, fruit-like body, united to it
by a point at its base. Examined through a microscope,
this little appendage looks like a golden pear. When
the leaf first unfolds the little pears are not quite ripe,
and the ants are continually employed going from one to
another examining them. When an ant finds one sufficiently
advanced it bites the small point of attachment;
then, bending down the fruit-like body, it breaks it off
and bears it away in triumph to the nest. All the fruit-like
bodies do not ripen at once, but successively, so that
the ants are kept about the young leaf for some time after
it unfolds. Thus the young leaves are always guarded by
the ants; and no caterpillar or larger animal could attempt
to injure them without being attacked by the little
warriors.” Thus, as Mr. Belt very aptly puts it, “the
ants are really kept by the acacia as a standing army to
<a id='Page_211'></a>protect its leaves from the attacks of herbivorous mammals
and insects.”<a id='r81'></a><a href='#f81' class='c016'><sup>[81]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c017'>As for the honey or honey-pot ants, they were first
heard of in America, and various floating stories, which
seemed more or less hard to credit, having got into circulation
about them, without there being any positive
knowledge to check them, Dr. McCook, to remove this
grave reproach to transatlantic entomology, started off
one day to observe them. He soon found that the main
fact which had been stated was correct, viz. that a certain
sect or caste of these ants, disregarding the Italian warning,
were in the habit of making themselves all honey, to
be swallowed in consequence by the rest of the community.
These are the so-called honey-pots, and so well do they
deserve their name, that when full the abdomen becomes
almost perfectly circular, like a glass globe, and so enormously
swollen that the body in proportion to it is like a
grain of wheat stuck into a cherry or gooseberry.<a id='r82'></a><a href='#f82' class='c016'><sup>[82]</sup></a> The
legs dangle towards the ground, but hardly, or only by a
great effort, reach it, and in this last state of distension
the insect may find it impossible to get about, though as
a rule by dragging or pushing herself along sideways, she
is able to do so to a certain extent. These honey-jars
have special chambers for their accommodation, and here
they hang in clusters from the roof, awaiting the visit
of any worker, who upon signifying his wants—it would
seem after climbing up to them—is fed, after the ordinary
ant manner, by regurgitation. In the same way
the honey-bearers are themselves filled, or more properly
<a id='Page_212'></a>speaking, feed themselves, since the mouth arrangement,
in spite of the direction in which things seem hastening,
has not yet become so simple as in the case of a real jar.</p>

<p class='c017'>The honey which the rotunds, as McCook calls them,
receive from the workers is gathered at night, and is
obtained almost entirely from the galls of oak trees,
which, when pierced by the ant’s mandibles, exude a white
transparent liquid in minute globules. This is greedily
licked up by the ants and distributed by them after
the return home, not only to the rotunds, but to such of
their fellow-workers as may not have taken part in the
expedition.<a id='r83'></a><a href='#f83' class='c016'><sup>[83]</sup></a> The honey thus obtained is pleasant to ant
and human taste alike, and the Indians of New Mexico, as no
doubt elsewhere, obtain it by the simple process of squeezing
the insect—breaking the honey-jar, as one may say.
They also make from it a fermented liquor having intoxicating
powers, so that one need not wonder that the idea
of farming the honey-ant, like the honey-bee, has been
seriously discussed in the United States. McCook, however,
has pointed out that “the limited quantity of the
product would prevent a profitable industry,” and he
adds: “Besides, the sentiment against the use of honey
thus taken from living insects, which is worthy of all
respect, would not be overcome.”<a href='#f83' class='c016'><sup>[83]</sup></a> Personally I think it
would be overcome, and pretty quickly, too, as are most
other sentiments that stand in the way of pleasure or
profit. Women would get it under first, as in the case of
birds, seals, etc., and the world would soon follow, with
“woman’s influence” upon its lips. But let me not be
unjust. I do not believe in sentiment as a working force
<a id='Page_213'></a>in the case at all. If the ants are not to be squeezed it
will be on commercial considerations.</p>

<p class='c017'>That the worker-ants—and for that matter the others
also—are extremely fond of the honey so curiously stored
by them, will be easily believed, and an unpleasant illustration
of their greediness in this respect was often observed
by McCook when capturing a nest. The swollen
bodies of the rotunds, on these occasions, were sometimes
unavoidably ruptured, whereupon such workers as happened
to be near these unfortunates, forgetting their
alarm, which had hitherto been great, and the ruin and
confusion all around them, paused in their flight, or aimless
movements, and greedily lapped up the overflowing
honey.<a id='r84'></a><a href='#f84' class='c016'><sup>[84]</sup></a> It is all the more interesting, therefore, to learn
that when the “little life” of these poor honey-pots is at
length “rounded with a sleep,” their contained treasure,
though so easily obtainable, goes with them to the grave,
the idea of opening the full crop, and imbibing the contents,
never seeming to occur to any ant. This is all the
more remarkable in that the workers, when they recognise
that life is extinct, carefully separate the abdomen from
the thorax by sawing through, with their mandibles, the
little connecting stalk called the petiole. The two parts
are then removed separately, that representing the head
half being carried, whilst the “golden bowl” of the body
“unbroken,” though with “the spirit fled for ever,” is
rolled along the various chambers and galleries of the
nest, till it finally finds a resting-place in the cemetery
just beyond its precincts.<a href='#f84' class='c016'><sup>[84]</sup></a> To what are we to attribute
the non-utilisation of the honey in the dead body? Even
<a id='Page_214'></a>were it possible that the ants could forget that it was
there, they cannot be unconscious of what must be smelt,
as well as seen, through the semi-transparent walls of the
abdomen. Some feeling must restrain them—what, I am
not prepared to say in a work which does not aim at being
scientific.</p>

<p class='c017'>Here, then, we have one most suggestive illustration—“suggestive,”
I think, is a very useful word—of the
funeral habits of ants. Many others could be instanced,
but I will end this chapter, and small account of ant
doings, generally, with the following extract from the
<i>Proceedings of the Linnæan Society</i> (1861). The observer
was a Mrs. Hutton, of Sydney; and Romanes, who quotes
her account in his <i>Animal Intelligence</i>, remarks that
though she is not a well-known observer the facts reported
were such as scarcely to admit of a mistake.
Personally, I attach no weight whatever to anybody’s not
being known as an observer. Want of leisure, or unpropitious
circumstances generally, must prevent large
numbers of people from seeing what they would be very
well able to note accurately if they did, or from recording
what they do see; whilst, on the other hand, leisure,
joined to taste in a certain direction, makes many a quite
average observer known as a good one. A good observer,
in fact, is rather one who is always keeping on, and does
not weary, than one who can see a single salient thing
more plainly than most other people; and, again, it is easy
to set a fictitious value merely on being before the public.</p>

<p class='c017'>Having thus defended Mrs. Hutton, I proceed now to
quote her account: “I saw,” she says, “a large number
<a id='Page_215'></a>of ants surrounding the dead ones” (soldier ants which she
had herself killed and left lying on the ground some half-hour
previously), “and determined to watch their proceedings
closely. I followed four or five that started off
from the rest towards a hillock a short distance off, in
which was an ants’ nest. This they entered, and in about
five minutes they reappeared, followed by others. All
fell into rank, walking regularly and slowly, two by two,
until they arrived at the spot where lay the dead bodies
of the soldier ants. In a few minutes two of the ants
advanced and took up the dead body of one of their
comrades; then two others, and so on, until all were ready
to march. First walked two ants bearing a body, then
two without a burden; then two others with another dead
ant, and so on, until the line was extended to about forty
pairs, and the procession now moved slowly onwards,
followed by an irregular body of about two hundred ants.
Occasionally the two laden ants stopped, and laying down
the dead one, it was taken up by the two walking unburdened
behind them, and thus, by occasionally relieving
each other, they arrived at a sandy spot near the sea.
The body of ants now commenced digging with their jaws
a number of holes in the ground, into each of which a dead
ant was laid, where they now laboured on until they had
filled up the graves. This did not quite finish the remarkable
circumstances attending this funeral of the ants. Some
six or seven individuals had attempted to run off without
performing their share of the task of digging; these were
caught and brought back, when they were at once
attacked by the body of ants and killed upon the spot.
<a id='Page_216'></a>A single grave was quickly dug, and they were all dropped
into it.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“Prodigious!” as Dominie Sampson would have said,
and certainly I think this is one of the most remarkable
observations upon ants that has ever been made. As far
as the burying is concerned, it has been corroborated by
the Rev. W. Farrar White, who, at the same time,
corroborates Pliny; but how strange are all the circumstances!
What was it, one wonders, that made just a few
of the crowd shirk their share of the labour—for this
is not like ants. Some strange, uncanny feeling in connection
with the dead bodies may be suspected; but
seeing that, as the Russian proverb truly says, “Another
man’s soul is darkness,” it is not very likely that we shall
ever know what ants feel.</p>

<p class='c017'>One interesting question is suggested in this connection,
though I have never known it raised yet. Two
views of what ants are, excluding compromises, may be
taken—the automatic one, tempered with “psychic
plasticity,” of Professor Wheeler, and that formed by
Mr. Belt, who, having fully satisfied himself—from the
keenest observation, be it remembered—of their reasoning
powers and capacities, remarks, “When we see these
intelligent insects dwelling together in orderly communities
of many thousands of individuals, their social instincts
developed to a high degree of perfection, making their
marches with the regularity of disciplined troops, showing
ingenuity in the crossing of difficult places, assisting each
other in danger, defending their nests at the risk of their
own lives, communicating information rapidly to a great
<a id='Page_217'></a>distance, making a regular division of work, the whole
community taking charge of the rearing of the young,
and all imbued with the strongest sense of industry, each
individual labouring not for itself alone, but for all its
fellows, we may imagine that Sir Thomas More’s description
of Utopia might have been applied with greater
justice to such a community than to any human society.”<a id='r85'></a><a href='#f85' class='c016'><sup>[85]</sup></a>
Now, if Belt’s view be the correct one, or if the evidence
in favour of it be at all strong, is it not time for us to ask
ourselves, merely as a moral problem, how far we, in our
clumsy and imperfect human state, have a right to kill
ants and tumble Utopia to pieces, simply for our amusement,
intellectual or otherwise? Ought we to do this?
Or ought we, like a lady who lives in America and writes
to very scientific papers, to imprison queens who do no
harm, and make ourselves learned at the expense of one,
or both of their antennæ, during the term of their natural
lives? However simply and sweetly we may talk of this,
however much true womanly feeling may enter into the
narrative, nay, even though we give the queens pet
names, is it really right?</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_0_4 c015'>THE consideration of ants naturally leads to that
of bees, but of the life and doings of the hive-bee—made
common now in a hundred practical
treatises and bee-keeper’s manuals—it is not the design
of this little book to treat. Wasps are less written
about, but even here, in a work which can only deal with
a very few insects out of a very great many, a choice may
be permitted one, so I will merely observe, in regard to
the common species, that in my opinion wasps are much
less irascible than bees—in fact, quite good-natured
compared to them—but at the same time, owing to their
room-entering, table-pillaging propensities, much greater
nuisances, so that they deserve stern treatment, but a
more charitable estimate of their character. Hornets,
again—which seldom offend in this way—appear to me
to be very peaceable insects, as though, wielding a mighty
weapon, they felt that they had no need to use it except
on “a striking emergency.” Such a definition would
<a id='Page_219'></a>apply to the running of a stage-coach, diligence, omnibus,
waggon, etc.—in fact, any large vehicle—into their nest
on the highway, in which case the consequences, one may
well believe, would be appalling. Never having been in
such a position myself, and being without trustworthy
information on the subject, my powers of description are
useless here, but there is a way of dealing with this
emergency also. This reminds me, however, of an account
which I have read somewhere or other of hornets having
once stopped a Roman army. This may seem surprising
nowadays, but we must remember that in classical times
armies did not possess artillery. There is therefore
nothing invidious in the opinion which I here express,
that however much they may have stopped the Romans,
they would never stop the Japanese.</p>

<p class='c017'>In both ants and bees we find solitary and social
species, so as in ants we have been considering the latter
only, we will now reverse the process with bees. There
are many interesting species of solitary bees, but it must
be premised that the word “solitary” is to be understood
here in a special rather than in a general sense. As far
as mere numbers are concerned, there is often a large
community of bees building their cells in close proximity
all at the same time, but each builds its cell for itself
alone, or rather for its family—no one thinks of helping
its neighbour. There is no co-operation, in fact, and
that makes all the difference. It would be all the same
to every one of the bees that are building so close
together if all the rest went away and left it to work
alone. And yet we cannot even quite say this, because,
<a id='Page_220'></a>in one case, at any rate, though every individual bee
makes its own cell and thinks only of that and of its
own family, yet, when all the cells are finished, the whole
community join in making one mud roof over the whole
of them. By this we see how difficult it is to find quite
separate places for allied animals, and how the habits of
one are apt to slide gradually into those of another.
Still, we must do the best we can, and take words as we
find them, remembering that the locusts, as already explained,
do <i>not</i> belong to the <i><span lang="la">locustidæ</span></i>.</p>

<p class='c002'>Aelian, in his “Natural History,” says that a city in Crete was attacked by
such a plague of hornets that the inhabitants were driven to abandon it,
and build a new city on another site. A hornet is shown to the right of
this inscription.</p>

<p class='c015'>Amongst the best known of the solitary species of
bees are the Carpenter Bees, the Carding and Tapestry
Bees, and the Mason Bees. Of the latter a great French
observer, who, though he lives now, belongs really to the
days of Réaumur and Swammerdam, has something to
tell us. Speaking not of Réaumur’s maison bee—that
“splendid Hymenopteron with its dark violet wings and
costume of black velvet”<a id='r86'></a><a href='#f86' class='c016'><sup>[86]</sup></a>—but of a smaller species—<i>Chalicodoma
sicula</i>—he says: “You should see the active
bee at work when the road is dazzling white in the hot
sunshine. Between the neighbouring farm where she is
building and the road where the mortar is prepared there
is a deep hum of the bees perpetually crossing each other
as they come and go. The air seems traversed by constant
trails of smoke, so rapid and direct is their flight. Those
who go carry away a pellet of mortar as big as small
shot: those who come settle on the hardest and driest
spots. Their whole body vibrates as they scratch with
the tips of their mandibles and rake with their forefeet
to extract atoms of earth and grains of sand, which,
<a id='Page_221'></a>being rolled between their teeth, become moist with
saliva, and unite. They work with such ardour that they
will let themselves be crushed under the foot of a passer-by
rather than move.”<a href='#f86' class='c016'><sup>[86]</sup></a> Then comes the making of the
actual nest, or little collection of cells. “After choosing
a boulder,” says Fabre, “she comes with a pellet of mortar
in her mandibles, and arranges it in a ring on the surface
of the pebble. The forefeet, and, above all, the mandibles,
which are her most important tools, work the material,
which is kept plastic by the gradually disgorged saliva.
To consolidate the unbaked clay, angular pieces of gravel
as large as a small bean are worked in singly on the outside
of the still soft mass. This is the foundation of the
edifice. Other layers are added, until the cell has the
required height of three or four centimetres. The masonry
is formed by stones laid on one another and cemented with
lime, and can stand comparison with our own. Layers
of mortar sparingly used hold them together. The cell
completed, the bee sets to work at once to store it. The
neighbouring flowers, especially those of <i><span lang="la">Genista scorpius</span></i>,
which in May turn the alluviums of the torrents golden,
furnish sugared liquids and pollen. She comes with her
crop swelled with honey, and all yellow underneath with
pollen dust, and plunges head first into the cell, where
for some moments one may see her work her body in a
way which tells that she is disgorging honey. Her crop
emptied, she comes out, but only to go in again at once,
this time backwards. With her two hind feet she now
frees herself from her load of pollen by brushing herself
underneath. Again she goes out, and returns head first.
<a id='Page_222'></a>She must stir the materials with her mandibles for a
spoon, and mix all thoroughly together. When the cell
is half full it is stored; an egg must be laid on the honey
paste, and the door has to be closed. This is all done
without delay. The orifice is closed by a cover of undiluted
mortar, worked from the circumference to the
centre. Two days, at most, seem required for the whole
work.”<a href='#f86' class='c016'><sup>[86]</sup></a> Afterwards several more cells—making a continuous
group of from six to ten—are added, and when
all is completed, the mason bee “builds a thick cover
over the whole group, which, being of a material impermeable
to water, and almost a non-conductor, is at
once a defence against heat and cold and damp. This
material is the usual mortar, made of earth and saliva,
only with no small stones in it. The nest is now a rude
dome, about as big as half an orange; one would take it
for a clod of mud flung against a stone, where it had
dried. Nothing outside betrays its contents—no suggestion
of cells, none of labour. To the ordinary eye it is
only a chance splash of mud.”</p>

<p class='c017'>Of course, when the eggs are hatched, the bee larvæ
feed on the stored pollen and honey, a pleasing picture
which suggests another something like it, though not
altogether the same. I allude to certain species of solitary
wasps, which, urged by the same feelings of maternal
solicitude, choose a living caterpillar, grasshopper, spider,
etc., for the future sustenance of their young. Take, for
instance, <i><span lang="la">Ammophila urnaria</span></i> of North America, whose
habits in this respect have been carefully studied. This
wasp is about an inch long, with very long legs, and a
<a id='Page_223'></a>waist even exaggeratedly wasp-like. It is black in colour,
but with a red mark running round the fore part of the
abdomen. At the proper time she—for, of course, we are
dealing with the female—may be seen running about the
ground, and eagerly searching the various plants and
grasses that come in her way. Occasionally, as though in
lightness both of heart and body, she gives a leap off the
ground, and at other times will fly up from it more deliberately,
to make an examination of some overhanging
leaf. At last, as a result of these little aerial excursions,
let us say, she knocks down a certain green caterpillar of
the kind wanted, and with maternal devotion full upon
her, at once sets to work. The caterpillar, however,
though taken by surprise, and assaulted the instant it
has touched the ground, resists strenuously, as though instinctively
knowing, and highly disapproving of, the fate
in store for it. It is larger and more bulky than the
wasp, and its contortions are so powerful that the latter is
several times repulsed in her assaults. She is not discouraged,
however, but continues perseveringly to fly at
the caterpillar, till at last she takes it at a disadvantage,
possibly in a moment of weariness, and alighting
with her long legs on each side of the large, soft body,
seizes it by the neck with her mandibles, and holds it
fast. Now the caterpillar, stimulated doubtless by the
painful, or at least unwelcome nip, struggles with redoubled
energy; but it is beneath its oppressor, who,
straddling over it and never relaxing her grasp, lifts it at
last, with an effort, a little from the ground, and inserting
her curved abdomen like a fish hook beneath it, strikes in
<a id='Page_224'></a>a more effective and certain way than did ever the most
benevolently contemplative member of all the fishing
fraternity. The result is instantly apparent, for with the
entry of that deadly sting into its body, all struggles on
the part of the caterpillar cease, and it lies a living corpse
at the feet of its cruel oppressor. The latter, after remaining
still for some moments as though to give her
victim time to realise and appreciate its situation, stings
it again and then again, each time choosing, as she has
done before, for the locality of the operation, the junction
of two out of the dozen or so segments into which the
long length of the caterpillar is divided. Then she flies
up, but after circling a little above the scene of her
triumph, she descends again, and gives her victim, though
now helpless and paralysed, a taste or two more of her
quality. The first part of her business is now done, and
well done. She has earned a rest, or rather she may
exchange one form of activity for another. Accordingly
she proceeds to indulge in the pleasures of the toilette, and
it is not till this is completely finished that she flies with,
or drags, her victim to the neat little burial-place, representing
also her future nursery, which she has already provided
for it.<a id='r87'></a><a href='#f87' class='c016'><sup>[87]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c017'>The above illustration is taken from the account of a particular
case which fell under the keen observation of G. W.
and E. G. Peckham, two well-known American entomologists.
On other occasions, however, this wasp—that is to
say, various individuals of the same species—besides
stinging the caterpillar, went through another and more
curious process. This consisted in biting and squeezing
<a id='Page_225'></a>the anterior upper portion—the neck as we may call it—of
their victim.<a href='#f87' class='c016'><sup>[87]</sup></a> The same operation was also observed
by Fabre when he watched his good mothers, but though
I have called it biting and squeezing, that is not the right
term for a <i><span lang="fr">savant</span></i> to employ. <i>He</i> calls it malaxation,
which, perhaps, means doing both at the same time.
Biting, however, would seem to imply no less, but,
perhaps in order to bite scientifically, it is necessary to
take a piece out, or at least to make the blood come,
though in common parlance this does not, or did not,
hold good, since Sampson bit his thumb at Abram and
Balthasar, in the first scene of <i>Romeo and Juliet</i>, but it
cannot be supposed—nor does the context support such a
view—that he bit it so hard as that. Malaxation, however,
let it be; but why such a process on the part of the
wasp should be necessary it is not easy to see, since the
mandibles are not poisonous like the sting, and the latter
is all in all sufficient to produce the paralysis required, as
is apparent in the instance already given, where the sting
alone was employed. To me it seems possible that this
malaxation may be a happiness to the wasp merely, as the
shaking of a rat certainly is to a terrier, whatever other
advantages accrue from it. That insects, like other
animals, including man—who, indeed, is the crowning
instance—take a savage pleasure in overpowering and
killing their prey, I have myself very little doubt.</p>

<p class='c017'>We have seen that this wasp stung the caterpillar
between the segments of its body, and, as we will assume—for
the result seems to warrant the inference—in the
central part of it, so that the sting, entering the great
<a id='Page_226'></a>nervous cord or ganglion, which is situated in this region,
with little swellings at each of the segmental rings, produced
the described paralysis. It was Fabre’s view that
this must always be the case, and he thought likewise, in
accordance with his own observation, that the caterpillar
received a sting at the junction of all or nearly all the
segments of its body. Otherwise it would be imperfectly
stung, and in consequence not sufficiently paralysed to
prevent its struggling, and so detaching the young larva,
or perhaps the egg, which, as it would seem, is laid on, and
not inside, the body of its living provisions. On the other
hand, were the caterpillar stung too severely, so as to be
killed outright, the grub when hatched would only have
putrid meat to feed upon, and this again, it was assumed,
would be fatal to its existence. On these grounds Fabre
concluded that we had here an instinct which must have
been perfect from the beginning, since as anything short
of such perfection would be followed by the death of the
larva, those gradual steps by which, on the theory of
natural selection, all excellence either of structure or
instinct has been attained, could not in a case like this
have had any existence.</p>

<p class='c017'>But all this has been exploded by subsequent observation.
What Fabre saw he knew, but in all that he inferred
without seeing he was entirely mistaken. As observed
by the Peckhams, a caterpillar may be either stung so
slightly as to be quite lively, and yet not succeed in
shaking off the wasp larva hatched on its body, or so
severely as to die almost immediately, yet without detriment
to the larva who feeds on its discoloured and
<a id='Page_227'></a>more or less putrified body, with the same gusto, and
apparent benefit, as though it were warm with life.<a href='#f87' class='c016'><sup>[87]</sup></a>
Thus the question seems not so much to be, how can
such perfection of instinct as was observed by Fabre have
been attained through the process of natural selection,
as why it should have been attained; or perhaps we may
even go further and ask if this supposed perfection exists
at all, and whether Fabre did not deceive himself. A
wasp having secured a caterpillar is, of course, at liberty
to sting it as often as it pleases. Why, then, should one
wasp behave quite like another one in this respect?
Here, as elsewhere, there would be some amount—perhaps
a considerable amount—of variation in individual disposition,
and wasps of milder or less savage mood would
sting less frequently than their fiercer fellows. There
might, therefore, as it appears to me, be a large amount
of fluctuation both in the number and degree of severity
of the stings—if indeed there is any regulation in this
respect—and also in the consequent injury to the
caterpillar or other insect, without any particular scope
being offered for natural selection to play a part. What
room, indeed, for such a force can there be if it makes
no difference to the wasp-grub whether the caterpillar
which is to be its food, is stung badly or slightly, or
whether it lives or dies?</p>

<p class='c017'>That this is really the case seems to be implied in
the following paragraph which I quote from the same
interesting work that I have before referred to<a href='#f87' class='c016'><sup>[87]</sup></a> “The
conclusions that we draw from the study of this genus
differ in the most striking manner from those of Fabre.
<a id='Page_228'></a>The one pre-eminent, unmistakable, and ever-present fact”
(the invariable fact, as one might say) “is variability.
Variability in every particular—in the shape of the nest
and the manner of digging it, in the condition of the
nest (whether closed or open) when left temporarily, in
the method of stinging the prey, in the degree of
malaxation, in the manner of carrying the victim, in the
way of closing the nest, and last and most important
of all, in the condition produced in the victims of the
stinging, some of them dying and becoming ‘veritable
cadavers,’ to use an expressive term of Fabre’s, long
before the larva is ready to begin on them, while others
live long past the time at which they would have been
attacked and destroyed if we had not interfered with the
natural course of events. And all this variability we
get from the study of nine wasps and fifteen caterpillars”!<a href='#f87' class='c016'><sup>[87]</sup></a>
Fabre’s ideas therefore seem totally disproved,
but though natural selection—the counter-theory to his
own—has no doubt produced the <i><span lang="la">Sphex</span></i> and <i><span lang="la">Ammophila</span></i>,
with their habit of stinging and storing caterpillars, to
serve as food for their young, it does not follow that
it has done anything more than this; for though
variation be the stuff in which natural selection works,
it need not always work in it—any more than a tailor
need always make clothes because there is an abundance
of cloth.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c002'>In the upper part of the picture a solitary wasp is seen attacking a caterpillar on a leaf.
Beneath is another of the same species busy pounding the entrance to its burrow with a
pebble.</p>

<p class='c015'>In the digging and closing of her burrow—her nesting-habits,
as we may call them—our <i><span lang="la">Ammophila</span></i> is almost
as interesting to watch as in her mode of proceeding
with caterpillars, though here a certain well-known
<a id='Page_229'></a>stimulus to human enjoyment which I need not enlarge
upon is wanting. Having found a convenient spot for
her nursery, she digs, with her mandibles and front pair
of legs, a little tunnel in the ground, to about the length
of her own body, and at the end of it hollows out a
round chamber or cavern just large enough to make
comfortable quarters for a pair of invalid caterpillars—a
hospital for incurables, we may call it to begin with, but
soon to become their tomb. Having dug to about her
middle, the wasp backs out, with a little pellet of collected
earth held firmly in her mandibles. With this she flies
to a little distance and then, letting it drop, alights on
the ground and takes a little rest before returning to
continue her work. She may either fly or run back, for
her legs are as highly developed as her wings—she is
in fact a very perfect athlete. The process of excavation is
now continued, there is more burrowing, more flying away
with the earth dug out, and before long the nursery-vault
is completed. The next thing is to find caterpillars
for it, but before flying away to look for one, <i><span lang="la">Ammophila</span></i>
carefully conceals the entrance to her tunnel with pellets
of earth, which she often brings from a distance, and
will not be satisfied with unless they seem well adapted
for their purpose. At last, when the aperture is both
blocked and hidden, she starts off upon the still more
important undertaking which has been already described,
and after a longer or shorter interval—if her quest is
successful—returns with a nicely stung caterpillar. As
two are required there must be another journey and
another stopping up of the burrow, before the final one,
<a id='Page_230'></a>which is of a more solid nature, occupying, sometimes,
as much as twenty minutes. In thus bringing her labours
to a conclusion, <i><span lang="la">Ammophila</span></i> often shows a wonderful
degree of intelligent foresight—foresight we must term it
if we admit the intelligence; for sometimes she will drag
a leaf over the entrance to the tunnel, though now filled
in, or taking a stone as large as her head in her mandibles,
will pound down the earth with it to make it firm and
compact.<a href='#f87' class='c016'><sup>[87]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c017'>It used to be said—and may be still by that large
class of people who are for ever making false parallels and
artificial distinctions—that man was the only animal that
made intelligent use of an instrument, but Darwin
instanced a monkey cracking a nut with a stone, and
an elephant breaking off a bough to fan itself with.
Here, in an insect, we have a case which is perhaps even
more to the point—more extraordinary, that is to say;
for certainly the idea of flattening and pressing down
earth over a general surface, and of taking something
to do it with, seems a little less obvious than that of
cracking a nut, in a similar manner, and therefore to
require more thought in the planner of such a process.
No wonder that the delighted witnesses of this interesting
fact flung themselves on the ground on each side of the unconscious
inspirer of their wonder, in order to have a
better sight of it; but that a previous observer of the
same thing should have waited a year before publishing
what he had seen, because he feared such a statement
would not be believed,<a href='#f87' class='c016'><sup>[87]</sup></a> is to my mind a display of
prudence almost as wonderful, though not nearly so
<a id='Page_231'></a>edifying, as that of <i><span lang="la">Ammophila</span></i> herself. If we are not
to make known what we see, because people who believe
in their own and nobody else’s eyesight are not likely
to credit it, how is evidence to accumulate for the benefit
of the more intelligent part of the community? It is only
of this small minority that we should think, or, rather, we
should not think of anything but the truth, where truth
is concerned.</p>

<p class='c017'>Returning to bees of the solitary kind, “the operations
of the wood-piercers,” says Bingley, “merit our careful
attention.” They shall have it for a moment, but space
is against them. However, the female of the species,
<i><span lang="la">Xylocopa violacea</span></i>, which for some reason is disliked by
householders, bores in the springtime, by the aid of her
strong mandibles alone, neat little circular tunnels in such
objects as garden-seats, gates, front doors, arbours,
window-shutters, rustic tables, and the like. At first, it
is stated, she “bores perpendicularly, but when she has
advanced about half an inch she changes her direction,
and then proceeds nearly parallel with its sides for twelve
or fifteen inches. If the wood of the seat, door, table, etc.,
be sufficiently thick, she sometimes forms three or four of
these long holes in its interior, a labour which for a single
insect seems prodigious, and in the execution of it some
weeks are sometimes employed. On the ground, for about
a foot from the place in which one of these bees is working,
little heaps of timber-dust are to be seen. These heaps
daily increase in size, and the particles that compose them
are almost as large as those produced by a hand-saw.”<a id='r88'></a><a href='#f88' class='c016'><sup>[88]</sup></a>
When the tunnels are finished, the mother bee divides
<a id='Page_232'></a>them into some dozen little rooms about an inch deep,
making the divisions of wood-dust, which she cements
together by aid of a glutinous secretion with which she is
furnished. Before each cell is closed it is filled with
a paste composed of the farina of flowers, mixed with
honey (it makes one envy the grub), and an egg is
deposited in it. As each cell takes some time to make
and provision, it is obvious that the egg in the lower
one will hatch a little sooner than the one above it,
and so on right up to the top. If, therefore, any one
of the larvæ “were to force its way upwards, which it
could easily do, it would not only disturb, but would infallibly
destroy all those lodged in the superior cells.”<a href='#f88' class='c016'><sup>[88]</sup></a>
Here, however, natural selection (called Providence in
Bingley’s time) steps in, and “has wisely prevented
this devastation, for the head of the nymph (chrysalis),
and consequently of the emerging bee, is always placed in
a downward direction.”<a href='#f88' class='c016'><sup>[88]</sup></a> Of course, therefore, the insect
moves forward in the direction towards which it looks
at birth—its new birth, that is to say; and, moreover—this
is the really astonishing thing—“the mother digs
a hole at the bottom of the long tube, which makes a
communication between the undermost cell and the open
air. By this contrivance, as all the bees instinctively
endeavour to cut their way downward, they find an
easy and convenient passage, for they have only to
pierce the floor of their cells in order to make their
escape, and this they do with their teeth very readily.”
As regards this communicating passage, however, it is
presumably a mere continuation of the tunnel, and was
<a id='Page_233'></a>probably once occupied with cells, like the upper portion.
Why the lower end of the tunnel should have come
in time to be left empty—what advantage, that is to say,
its being so represents—it is not easy to see, but possibly
it stood in danger of being reached by a bird’s beak,
through what has now become the exit of escape merely.</p>

<p class='c017'>As there is a leaf-cutting ant, so, too, there is a leaf-cutting
bee, but here the resemblance ends, since no
thought of food or fungus enters the mind of the latter
insect. Her more simple and direct object is to make the
severed leaves into cells, and this she does with wonderful
skill and ingenuity. The cells, which are made by rolling
the pieces of leaves round within a tunnel or gallery,
previously excavated in the earth, are separated from one
another by a circular piece, which fits into the tube with
extreme nicety, making at once the ceiling of each lower
compartment and the floor of that above it. As each
is finished the bee, as in the other instances, fills it with
a mixture of honey and pollen, upon which she then lays
an egg, and finally closes the mouth of the tunnel. The
leaf principally used for the manufacture of these pretty
cradles is the rose leaf, and the paste which fills them is
of a rose-red colour, owing to the pollen having been
collected for the most part from thistles.</p>

<p class='c017'>The children of the leaf-cutting bee, therefore, are
delicately housed, but what are they, in this respect, to
those of the poppy or tapestry bee, who are born like the
Byzantine princes in a “purple<a id='r89'></a><a href='#f89' class='c016'><sup>[89]</sup></a> chamber” made of the
<a id='Page_234'></a>rich leaves of poppies? Here they lie, or crawl, in state,
one to each royal apartment, which is filled, almost to
the brim, with the sweet food of bees. Yet when they
come forth, at last, it is not as gorgeous imperial creatures
clothed in “purple and pall,” but only little ordinary-looking
black bees covered all over with dirty grey hair.
And their beautiful purple poppy chamber has been seen
by no one—not even by themselves probably—buried as
it is full three inches deep in the earth. Wallace, somewhere
in his <i><span lang="la">Malay Archipelago</span></i>, moralises over the beautiful
little kingbird of paradise, sparkling out its life
amidst the forest solitudes of a remote island, unseen by
human eyes, save those of savages, till once or twice,
perhaps, in a century, some wandering white man, who
alone is capable of appreciating its beauty, comes to bang
its life out and bear away its skin. The thought of this
dainty little crimson-tapestried bower lying in black
darkness, like a grave beneath one’s feet, rouses a similar
train of reflection in the mind, but perhaps it would do
so more strongly were it associated in the same degree
with ideas of sport or profitable collecting.</p>

<p class='c017'>The carding-bee is interesting, not so much for the nest
which it makes, as for the wonderful way in which it
makes it—or, to express it more justly, it is more especially
interesting on this account. Having either made or
found a suitable cavity, these bees under-roof it with a
thick thatching of moss. To carry this, bit by bit, to the
place, would take them a very long time, so, instead of
doing so, they stand one behind another, with their backs
toward the nest, in a line that reaches from the moss to
<a id='Page_235'></a>its entrance. The furthest bee then pulls out a piece
with her mandibles, cards it with her fore feet, and, with
the others, passes it on, beneath her body, to the second
bee, who passes it to the third, the third to the fourth,
and so on, all down the line, the last bee entering the
nest with it. Thus these bees do with moss exactly what
rats have been seen to do with eggs, when transporting
them to their burrows. A most interesting anecdote of
this is quoted by Romanes,<a id='r90'></a><a href='#f90' class='c016'><sup>[90]</sup></a> from Jesse’s <i>Gleanings</i>, but it
does not appear to be in my edition, which I had thought
was a complete one. All I can find is a bare reference to
their having been known to “convey” eggs from a box, in
this way—“convey the wise it call.” This is an annoying
discovery, for I detest all selections, not made by myself,
from Palgrave’s <i>Golden Treasury</i> to any man’s “Hundred
Rest Books.” But if my edition <i>is</i> a complete one, then
the thing should be looked into, for the anecdote quoted
by Romanes is not there—at least it is untraceable through
the index.</p>

<p class='c017'>Like ants, bees are subject to parasites, and as some
belonging to the former are ants themselves, so with bees
we have the same thing, but developed to a still more striking
extent; for there is no ant that I know of that lives
with another which it so closely resembles that the latter
is unable to distinguish it from itself. Such bees, however,
there are. Some of our humble bees, for instance, go
through life thus attended by a double whose existence it
never for one moment suspects. The two, indeed, are
linked in the closest bonds of social intimacy. Together
they leave the nest, together they fly from flower to
<a id='Page_236'></a>flower, together they re-enter it. Together, too, they
seem to glow in industry—to emulate each other’s toil.
But all the while that the true industrious bee is collecting
pollen and nectar the double is only pretending to do
so—or rather, let us say, seeming—and whilst the former
bustles about, feeding the larvæ and making the cells, the
latter only bustles about, like the shadow of a busy person
on the wall. But when the true bee lays an egg, the
double lays one too, almost at the same moment, and in
the very same cell. Both are then hatched, together, and
the two larvæ grow up in the same cradle, nourished by
the same food, make their transformation side by side, and
so creep forth into the nest. The two, as I say, are hardly
to be distinguished one from another, yet all the while
one is a real true-hearted humble bee, and the other a
mere show, a stage make-up, an outer shell without any
of the proper qualities inside. And the best of the joke
is, that, probably, the false or cuckoo bee, as it is called,
is as much deceived as its foster relatives, and imagines
itself a good honest sterling member of the community.
It is forced by nature to cheat, but the fraud is unconscious,
and the impostor is imposed on in its turn.</p>

<p class='c017'>Thus in the insect world we have something which can
only be brought about, amongst ourselves, through a
conscious disguise, by means of wigs, false moustaches, etc.—what
we call an impersonation—but here is a life-long
impersonation which costs the “born actor” no trouble.
Why is this? What is the meaning of it? Why should
one bee—or any other insect or creature—look just like
another one, and yet have a Latin name of its own, which
<a id='Page_237'></a>the other has no right to? Why should the individuals
of one species be hardly more like each other than they
are like the individuals of another species, even though—as
is often the case—these two species are widely separated
in the system of nature? Such are the questions to which
a consideration of these cuckoo-bees, as they are called,
give rise. They will be answered, if at all, in the following
chapter.</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_2_0_4 c015'>EVERYBODY knows nowadays how all the different
species of animals and plants, living and extinct,
have come into existence. It was quite simple.
All they had to do was to keep on varying. Some of
them varied in a way that was good for them, some in
a way that was bad. The latter died, but the others
increased and multiplied, and as the process was always
going on, and it is impossible to vary long without becoming
changed, it happened that creatures which had
started with a certain appearance got in time to have
quite another one, so that they would not have been
recognised by the people who used to know them, if these
same people had kept alive. However, as the process
was so slow that it took millions of years, and is still
going on, awkward things of this sort never happened,
and so, as nobody had ever seen one species of animal
change into another before their eyes, they found it
difficult to believe that they ever had done so; for the
ordinary person says “seeing’s believing,” though he
believes in all sorts of things that neither he nor anyone
<a id='Page_239'></a>else ever has seen, or is ever likely to. Still, for all that,
he thinks his own eyesight must be better than anyone
else’s.</p>

<p class='c017'>This process of eternal change, with the changes for
the better surviving, and those for the worse dying out, is
what is called natural selection, and if we understand it—as
there are few now who do not—we can understand this,
that if any kind of creature is so strong and formidable
that it would be an advantage for weaker creatures to be
mistaken for it, then it is not at all unlikely that some of
these weaker creatures will get more and more to resemble
it, until at last they are so mistaken. For instance, our
common wasps, who are armed with a formidable sting,
and are very skilful in using it, are not attacked by any
other insect, excepting hornets, which are not common.
Any fly or moth, therefore, that resembles a wasp will be
generally left alone, and the more so the more it resembles
it. Accordingly we do find flies and moths that look
very like wasps, and live safely in consequence. Still
more would it be of advantage to look like a hornet, and
there is a moth so like one that it is called the Hornet-clear-wing.</p>

<p class='c017'>On this same principle of being mistaken for something
that is safe from attack or annoyance, all sorts of animals,
and in a special degree insects, have come to look like
various objects around them, and amidst which they live,
such as stems of grass, pieces of moss or stick, leaves,
flowers, and so on—some of the resemblances being more
special and extraordinary. These are things which,
though the eye may see, it does not as a rule dwell upon,
<a id='Page_240'></a>because there are so many others round about. Who, for
instance, would look at any particular blade of grass?
So a bird that would pounce down upon an insect that it
saw moving amongst the leaves of a tree, if there was no
doubt that it was an insect, would not take any pains
to examine what only looked like one leaf amongst many.</p>

<p class='c017'>Thus, throughout nature we have these curious resemblances
of certain creatures to certain other creatures,
or to the plants or inanimate objects around them, but it
is principally amongst insects that the phenomenon is met
with, probably because they increase and multiply so
quickly that there has been more time both for the laws
of inheritance and for the great controlling one of natural
selection to have come into play. Whatever is the reason,
there is no doubt about the fact, which will be best
illustrated by one or two salient instances.</p>

<p class='c017'>Ants, though they fall a prey to various animals larger
than themselves—such as birds or ant-eaters—yet in
their relations with other insects occupy a position of
comparative safety, on account of their weapons and
pugnacity, and, still more, of their numbers. The driver
ants of equatorial Africa, and their South American
representatives, the <i><span lang="la">ecitons</span></i>, are indeed, when they set
out on their foraging expeditions, the terror, not only
of insects, but of all animal life. “Wherever they
move,” says Bates, referring to the latter, “the whole
animal world is set in commotion, and every creature tries
to get out of their way.”<a id='r91'></a><a href='#f91' class='c016'><sup>[91]</sup></a> This, however, as they climb
trees, and send out encircling columns which enclose a
considerable extent of ground, is difficult, or rather, impossible,
<a id='Page_241'></a>for all such as cannot fly some distance without
alighting; for if an ant or two once seize upon them all
is over. An insect, therefore, that cannot evade the onset
of such an enemy is lucky if it has some such means of
ensuring its safety as has been above referred to. One at
least thus specially favoured inhabits Nicaragua. “I was
much surprised,” says Mr. Belt, “with the behaviour of a
green leaf-like locust. This insect stood immovably
amongst a host of ants, many of which ran over its legs,
without ever discovering there was food within their reach.
So fixed was its instinctive knowledge that its safety depended
on its immovability, that it allowed me to pick it
up and replace it amongst the ants without making a
single effort to escape. It might easily have escaped from
the ants by using its wings, but it would only have fallen
into as great a danger, for the numerous birds that
accompany the army of ants are ever on the outlook for
any insect that may fly up, and the heavy flying locusts,
grasshoppers, and cockroaches have no chance of escape.”<a id='r92'></a><a href='#f92' class='c016'><sup>[92]</sup></a>
This locust resembled a green leaf which, as we have
seen, was a very protective resemblance indeed. It might,
however, had it been a smaller insect, have resembled one
of the ants themselves, and in that case could have run
about with them, pretending or appearing to forage, also
with perfect impunity. Whether the <i><span lang="la">Eciton</span></i> has such a
double I know not, but various ants have. With some it
is a spider that assumes their form. With others, as we
have seen to a partial extent, a caterpillar, but the <i><span lang="la">Sauba</span></i>,
or leaf-cutting ant—which is also the mushroom-growing
one—is understudied, leaf and all, by an insect which,
<a id='Page_242'></a>though the order to which it belongs has been determined,
has not yet apparently received a name. “An example,”
says Professor Poulton, “of protective mimicry, which I
believe to be more wonderful in its detail and complexity
than any which has been hitherto described, was observed
and interpreted by my friend Mr. W. L. Sclater, in 1886,
during his investigations in British Guiana. Mr. Sclater
and his native servant had been collecting insects by
shaking the branches of a tree over a sheet. The servant,
although described as a very acute observer, saw an insect
on the sheet which he mistook for one of the abundant
Cooshie ants (perhaps the native name), carrying its little
jagged segment of leaf over its back. Mr. Sclater looked
more closely, and saw that it was an entirely different
insect belonging to the order <i><span lang="la">Homoptera</span></i>. Its length was
about that of an ant carrying its leaf. The leaf was
represented by the thin flattened body of the insect which
in its dorsal part is so compressed laterally that it is no
thicker than a leaf” (or as we would say, which along the
back is no thicker than a leaf), “and terminates in a sharp,
jagged edge. The head and legs were brown, and suggested
the appearance of that part of an ant which is
uncovered by the piece of leaf. The jagged dorsal line,
when seen in profile, evidently corresponds to the roughly
gnawed edge of the fragment of leaf, for Mr. Sclater tells
me that the contour of the latter is generally shaped by
the mandibles of the ant rather than due to the natural
margin.”<a id='r93'></a><a href='#f93' class='c016'><sup>[93]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c017'>The above-mentioned insect is a dweller in trees, and
one might have supposed that a general resemblance to
<a id='Page_243'></a>the leaves among which it moves would have been a
sufficient protection for it. This probably was the
beginning of the deception, which became more complex
as time went on. In the leaf-like back of the
insect we see probably the original disguise, but as the
eyes of birds became more acute they began to pierce
through it, more especially when the creature walked.
Round about the would-be leaf, however, the leaf-cutting
ants—distasteful to the birds that so affected it—were
constantly moving and walking. If only it could get
to resemble one of these it might be as active as it
pleased, and especially if its motions, as well as its
appearance, became ant- or ant and leaf-like. And this,
indeed, was what gradually began to take place. Variation
was always going on, and natural selection was
always at hand to mould and shape its results. The two
insects were, to begin with, of much the same size, and
the general leaf-like appearance of the one was a good
basis on which the more particular resemblance to the
cut piece of leaf, carried by the other, might be founded.
A few deeper washes of brown, some not very profound
modifications of contour, and an ant-suggesting legs and
body began to appear beneath it. Meanwhile, however,
hundreds of thousands—nay, millions—of bad or mediocre
copies were swept away, the species became rarer and
rarer—trembled, perhaps, on the verge of extinction;
but just when it might have appeared to the birds, who
were no longer able to obtain a once much-enjoyed morsel,
that it really was extinct, it was saved; nature’s object
had been gained. A certain number of individuals were
<a id='Page_244'></a>left, were close at hand even; even now, at that very
moment, one might be crawling on the same twig where
a despondent bird sat, only it was not to be distinguished
from a leaf-cutting ant. Such are the ways of nature,
such the slaughter that attends her victories.</p>

<p class='c017'>In Borneo, and the Malay Archipelago generally, there
is a pretty pink flower known as the “Straits Rhododendron.”
Once a gentleman was looking at one of
these flowers and admiring it, when all at once it turned
round and stared him in the face. It was not a flower,
but a mantis; its flattened legs—pink like them—made
the petals; its abdomen, turned up over the back and
held thus motionless, resembled an opening bud. “When
I held the branch on which the insect had established
itself in my hand I could not tell exactly where animal
tissue commenced and where flower ended, so perfectly
was the one assimilated to the other, both in colour and
surface-texture.”<a id='r94'></a><a href='#f94' class='c016'><sup>[94]</sup></a> When once established on a flower
this mantis would remain there quite motionless, if undisturbed,
until it had occasion to leave it; and of course,
in nature, had any insect settled on or near it, it would
have instantly been seized. The ways of the mantis are
well known. “Under a most sanctimonious aspect,” says
Fabre, speaking of the little green one of Provence, “it
hides the morals of a cannibal”;<a id='r95'></a><a href='#f95' class='c016'><sup>[95]</sup></a> and, indeed, the female,
which is larger and stronger than the male, will often turn
upon the latter and devour it in the very midst of a love-passage.
This it does, as in all other cases, by suddenly
launching forward one or both of its fore-arms—which
have been previously held in an attitude of prayer—and
<a id='Page_245'></a>enclosing the body of the victim between their first and
second segments, each of which is toothed along the edge
like a saw. The double row of teeth meet in the body,
which, held aloft, and writhing on either side of the
trap, is devoured piecemeal by the mantis, who, with
its sharp jaws, tears little mouthfuls out of it as long
as it, or its appetite, lasts. This process, made more
interesting by the way in which it was brought about, was
witnessed in the case of the above-mentioned species.
Small flies frequently settled upon it as it sat motionless,
flower-like amidst flowers. “These it made no attempt
either to drive off or to capture; its motions seeming rather
to attract than repel them. After a short time a larger
<i><span lang="la">Dipteron</span></i>, as big as a common house-fly, alighted on the
inflorescence within reach of the predatory limbs. Then
the mantis became active immediately; the fly was seized,
torn in pieces, and devoured.”<a id='r96'></a><a href='#f96' class='c016'><sup>[96]</sup></a> Such are the real propensities
of the seeming flower, and such, too, it may
be observed, are those of some actual flowers—to wit,
insectivorous ones.</p>

<p class='c017'>To the Malays, however, whose minds are not yet open
to the doctrines of protective or aggressive resemblance,
or to evolution generally, this mantis <i>is</i> a flower, they
“know not seems.” The blossoms of “the <i>sendudok</i>”
have become alive, and perhaps some analogies suggested
by their own life-experience temper their surprise at such
an apparent change of disposition. They say, too, that
few men ever see more than one flower-mantis in the
whole course of their lives, so rare a creature is it. In
this, no doubt, they are right; yet it would be possible,
<a id='Page_246'></a>perhaps, even for a Malay to see several without knowing
anything about it. Native eyes are almost always sharper
and better than those of the Europeans who come
amongst them; but, on the other hand, no native goes
about like a modern entomologist, with his eyes specially
open in one direction and the possibilities of protective
resemblance in his mind.</p>

<p class='c017'>The same naturalist, during the same expedition, was
singularly delighted to secure a larva, whose resemblance
to a snake was “so startlingly accurate that I was, for
a moment, completely deceived.”<a href='#f96' class='c016'><sup>[96]</sup></a> A description follows
which, as it is of that kind which deals longly and
learnedly in details without producing any particular
general effect, may be left out. It would seem, however,
that this caterpillar, like many others, has the power
of withdrawing its actual head into a fold or two of its
skin, which is here so marked that it performs the office
of a mask, obscuring and taking the place of the real
head thus obliterated. The mask is furnished with two
spots, which at once become the creature’s eyes, and both
in colour, shape, and general appearance bear a remarkable
resemblance to those of a snake; whilst a wrinkled
fold, running back on either side from what appears to be
the snout, suggests the mouth, and the flattened head
with its characteristic arrangement of broad, flattened
scales is also indicated by certain markings and colours
on the required part of the caterpillar’s body. An
apparent head like this, thrown suddenly up as though
threatening to dart forward with a hiss and distended
jaws, might alarm anyone, and such a mock demonstration
<a id='Page_247'></a>is evidently required to give full effect to the disguise. Thus
we are told that “when the larva was moving about with
the anterior segments well expanded the resemblance to
a snake was not so startling; but directly it was touched
the terrifying attitude was assumed, the anterior segments
being drawn in and the front of the body turned towards
the aggressor. When, at the same time, the hinder part
of the body was hidden by leaves the deception became
complete, and if effective enough to deceive, even temporarily,
a human being, it must surely be equally effective
in deterring less highly organised and timid foes.”</p>

<p class='c017'>For the “timid” certainly, but for the “less highly
organised” the conclusion does not seem so plain. No
sight is better than a bird’s, and it is practice that makes
perfect in any particular direction. Still, unless we
suppose the disguise to be accidental merely—and this
no one with a knowledge of the whole subject can do—the
object of it seems clearly apparent, and we may, therefore,
assume that, on the whole, it is successful—to the extent,
at any rate, of keeping the species in existence. In such
matters, however, there is nothing like practical experiments,
if one has the chance of making them, as the
finder of the caterpillar in question must have had, since
he says, “Unfortunately I was unable to test the efficacy
of the disguise, for fear of losing the larva, which I was
anxious to rear for the purpose of identification.”<a href='#f96' class='c016'><sup>[96]</sup></a> To
me this appears a false judgment. Such a test would
have been much more interesting, surely, especially if
resulting in the way anticipated, than a dry pinned specimen
and a Latin name.</p>

<p class='c017'><a id='Page_248'></a>Another large snake-resembling caterpillar was found
by Bates in the forests of Brazil, and the likeness was
sufficiently striking to alarm several people to whom
he showed it. But it is not necessary to go so far afield,
for here in England, according to Professor Poulton, we
have an excellent example of this kind of protective
resemblance. This is no other than the caterpillar of
the elephant hawk-moth, which by withdrawing its head
into its body—just as does the Bornean species—produces
a similar false face, with a pair, or, indeed, two pairs
of fierce-looking eyes.<a id='r97'></a><a href='#f97' class='c016'><sup>[97]</sup></a> This caterpillar feeds on the
great willow herb, and when at rest keeps amongst the
dead brown leaves at the base of the stem. “As soon,”
says Professor Poulton, “as the leaves are rustled by an
approaching enemy, the caterpillar swiftly draws its head
and the three first body-rings into the two next rings,
bearing the eye-like marks. These two rings are thus
swollen, and look like the head of the animal, upon
which four enormous, terrible-looking eyes are prominent.
The effect is greatly heightened by the suddenness of the
transformation, which endows an innocent-looking and
inconspicuous animal with a terrifying and serpent-like
appearance.”<a id='r98'></a><a href='#f98' class='c016'><sup>[98]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c017'>With this caterpillar, since naturalists know what to
call it, and there is no chance of its handing down any of
their names in Latin to posterity, it has been possible to
make experiments, and on the whole perhaps they have
<a id='Page_249'></a>been in favour of the protective resemblance theory. The
most interesting one—that I have read, that is to say—was
made by Professor Poulton with a full-sized green lizard,
and is thus described by him: “The lizard was evidently
suspicious, and yet afraid to attack the caterpillar, which
maintained the terrifying attitude in the most complete
manner throughout. The lizard kept boldly advancing,
and then retreating in fright; but at each advance it
approached rather nearer to the caterpillar. After this
had taken place many times and nothing had happened,
the lizard grew bolder and ventured to gently bite what
appeared to be the head of the caterpillar; it then
swiftly retired, but finding that there was no retaliation it
again advanced and gave it a rather harder bite. After a
few bites had been given in this cautious manner, the
lizard appeared satisfied that the whole thing was a fraud,
and devoured the caterpillar in the ordinary manner.”<a href='#f98' class='c016'><sup>[98]</sup></a>
Professor Poulton has no doubt as to the lizard having
been alarmed at first by the appearance of the caterpillar,
and adds that he has never seen one act in the same
way on any other occasion; other large hawk-moth
caterpillars being eaten at once with entire <i><span lang="fr">sang-froid</span></i>.
It may be observed, however, that if every lizard were to
act in the way recorded, under natural conditions, the
advantage to the caterpillar would be nil, since though a
species may survive through not being eaten, it certainly
will not through being eaten with hesitation. And why
should a lizard be more timid in the open air than in
a box or a fern-case? Unless we assume, therefore, that
this particular one was bolder than most others would be,
<a id='Page_250'></a>the result of the experiment was not for, but against, the
theory it was designed to test; and since we have no
business to assume, the only thing to do is to get more
caterpillars, and give them to more lizards. Small birds,
however—and this in a country like England is more to the
point—seem really to fear these pseudo-snakes to the
extent of flying away from them.<a id='r99'></a><a href='#f99' class='c016'><sup>[99]</sup></a> But would an ordinary
large caterpillar of the <i><span lang="la">Sphingidæ</span></i>—say, of a privet hawk
or death’s-head moth—frighten them in the same way? If
so, then again we are nowhere.</p>

<p class='c017'>Perhaps a still more extraordinary instance of protective
resemblance than any of the foregoing is that of
a caterpillar which pretends to be an ant—one provided
with an efficient sting, and of an irritable disposition.
Here, as in the snake cases, it is by one portion of the
body only that the fraud is perpetrated, but this, instead
of being the front, is the hind part, in which, perhaps, it
offers a unique example of the sort. The colour of the
caterpillar is exactly that of the ant, and whilst its extremity
represents the latter’s head, two black spots which
are there situated bear an equally close resemblance
to the eyes. The jaws are represented by the last pair of
false legs or claspers, which are of disproportionate size,
and can upon occasion be stretched widely apart, whilst a
number of thin, tentacle-like processes, attached in pairs
to the segments of the body, have all the appearance of an
ant’s legs and antennæ. Armed with these properties,
which, however, in a state of quiescence are not very
recognisable, the caterpillar waits, as one may say,
to have its feelings ruffled, when, by flinging the hinder
<a id='Page_251'></a>part of its body into the air, each separate appurtenance
begins at once to act the part assigned it, and the whole
becomes a startling make-up. The head, with eyes, is
jerked from side to side, the jaws gape, the legs move, the
antennæ quiver, and an angry, threatening ant starts,
as by magic, into being. “When,” says Mr. Annandale,
“the caterpillar is seen in an end-on position, or when the
anterior two-thirds of the body are hidden, the resemblance
is positively startling,” so that “it is difficult to
imagine how a lizard or a frog with a previous experience
of the ant could fail to be deterred.”<a id='r100'></a><a href='#f100' class='c016'><sup>[100]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c017'>In the light of the above cases, that of the cuckoo-bees
does not seem so very wonderful, since both the
species are bees, and all or most of the members of any
group or family of animals as a rule bear some resemblance
to one another, since they descend from a common
and not very remote ancestor. Many flies, however, have
almost as close a resemblance to various bees and wasps,
whilst one of the latter is even the model for a species of
cricket, which would otherwise fall a victim to it and
others of its family. There is a beetle, too, so like a
wasp, not only in its appearance, but in the way in which
it runs about and moves its antennæ, that anyone almost
would be taken in. Whether, under this disguise, it
enters wasps’ nests and preys upon the larvæ, as the bee-like
<i><span lang="la">Volucella</span></i> flies enter the nests of the humble-bees
they imitate, I do not know, nor, I think, does anyone,
but this might very well be the case. These flies, however,
now I come to think of it, do not really injure the
bees. It used to be the idea that they did, but lately it
<a id='Page_252'></a>has been discovered that they are only scavengers, feeding
on all the waste products of their hosts, and even on their
dead bodies should such opportunities arise.<a id='r101'></a><a href='#f101' class='c016'><sup>[101]</sup></a> The humble-bees,
on their part, seem to appreciate these services,
though we are not entitled to say that they admit the
flies into their nests on this account, since they probably
do so owing to their likeness to themselves.</p>

<p class='c017'>Of the walking-stick insects, which are hardly to be
distinguished, even with close attention, from the grass
or twigs on which they cling, everyone has heard or read,
and the caterpillars, common enough in England, which
remain motionless, projecting like a twig from its stem,
and looking just the same as one, are almost as good
instances of unconscious deception. But neither these
caterpillars, nor any of the other insects that have been
mentioned, do anything, except through the attitudes
they assume, to produce their wonderful disguises. They
have nothing to do with the cutting out of the material.
They do not dress up for the part themselves. That,
however, is what some caterpillars do. There is one, for
instance, in Borneo, that has a number of spines arranged
in pairs down its back, and on each of these spines it
fixes several little buds of the plant on which it is feeding,
such buds, and not the leaves of the plant, being the
actual food it eats. Consequently the caterpillar, which
is quite a small one, looks like a spray of tiny buds itself,
and can hardly, by possibility, be noticed amidst its
flowery chaplet. The buds are not impaled on the spines,
as might be supposed, but are attached to them with silk,
which the caterpillar weaves for the purpose, and the
<a id='Page_253'></a>whole process of the thing has been observed by the
gentleman who gives the account, and who is no less competent
a person than the curator of the Sarawak Museum.
This is what he says: “A bud would be shorn off with
the mandibles, then held in the two front pairs of legs,
and covered all over with silk issuing from the mouth
of the caterpillar. The caterpillar then twisted the
front part of its body round, and attached with silk
the bud to one of the spinous processes, and another bud
would then be attached to this, and so on until a
sufficiently long string—generally three or four buds—was
made, when operations on another spine would be
commenced. The caterpillar fed on these buds, scooping
out the interior, and when not hurried, using the empty
shells in preference to whole buds for its covering. When
irritated it curled up, and remained thus for fifteen or
twenty minutes. At other times it would sway about,
looking like a branchlet blown by the breeze.”<a id='r102'></a><a href='#f102' class='c016'><sup>[102]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c017'>In time this caterpillar made “a silk cocoon covered
with buds,” but it never turned into a butterfly, for ants
attacked it, and its life was nipped in the bud. It appears to
be a very rare caterpillar, and nobody knows what butterfly
it belongs to, or what is its full Latin name. Since it
is a <i>Geometer</i>, however, why not <i><span lang="fr">Geometer ignota</span></i> under a
sketch (as given in <i>Nature</i>, June 25th, 1903), in the
cabinet—which would, in all cases, be the better plan?</p>

<p class='c017'>I really do not know whether this or another caterpillar
of South America be the more extraordinary, for if
the one makes itself like something, the other makes
something like itself. <i><span lang="la">Anæa</span></i> (<i>sp?</i>)—I give the name as I
<a id='Page_254'></a>find it—is a little green caterpillar having a very funny
nondescript sort of shape—as much like a little piece of
gnawed-out leaf, left hanging to the midrib, as anything
else. Such an object, however, is not one of the common
ones of nature, and if it stood alone might be unrecognised
or misinterpreted. The caterpillar, therefore, feeding
along the midrib of the leaf, gnaws out a number of
such little pieces, more or less like itself, and leaves them
sticking upright along it, attached by a point or two.
All the rest of the leaf at that part of the midrib, it
apparently eats, or bites away, so that there remains only
the slender, bare stalk, with several bits of leaf upon it,
one of which is the caterpillar. To say which bit is he is
now very difficult, and it looks as if none of them were.
This caterpillar is, of course, green, like the leaf he feeds
on, but he is not the same colour all over. He is light
above and dark below, and this exactly suits—I have it
on authority—the chiaroscuro of the situation, so that,
both in light and shadow, he looks for all the world like a
little elongated bit of green leaf attached to the midrib
by a couple of stalks.<a id='r103'></a><a href='#f103' class='c016'><sup>[103]</sup></a> One would say, “Some caterpillars
must have been eating that leaf”; but one would
never think the caterpillar that had been eating it was
still there.</p>

doubles—Suggested explanation—More evidence wanted—Warning
coloration—A theory on trust—A straightforward test—Advice
to naturalists—A strange omission.</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_2_0_4 c015'>SOME of the most remarkable instances of protective
resemblances amongst insects are exhibited by
butterflies, one, perhaps, being the most perfect
existing under nature; however, I only say perhaps. This
is the world-renowned leaf butterfly of Sumatra, and
elsewhere in the Malay Archipelago. Of the great purple
emperor family, it is purple on the upper surface, and
gleams like a meteor as it shoots about in the rich, sun-bathed
atmosphere of the tropics, its conspicuousness
being enhanced by a sort of miniature, sharp-pointed
swallow-tail, in which the hinder pair of wings end, and a
broad, orange bar, like a sash or scarf of honour, running
right across the anterior wings. It flies boldly and
strongly, and when it descends upon a bush or shrub it is
as though a little purple torch had shot through the
foliage; but all at once, even though you see it come
down just in front of you, it has vanished utterly—the torch
has gone out. You may look and look, but unless you
know the trick, and have seen the settling, and never taken
your eyes off the exact spot, you will never find the
<a id='Page_256'></a>butterfly, or see anything more of it until, all at once,
it gleams in the air again. For the under part of the
leaf butterfly’s lovely purple wings is like the leaf indeed—“the
sere, the yellow leaf”—with a midrib running
down the centre veinings on either side, a curled tip at
the top, a stalk at the bottom, and everything proper to
leaves, but not as a rule to butterflies. All four wings
join in this effect, for being thrown up in the usual way
when the insect settles, the leaf-like shape is thus brought
about, one-half of the under surface being seen on each
side in clear profile, whilst the purple now lies hid within,
like the pictures on a folded screen. As for the body of
the butterfly, that is hidden inside the wings too; the
legs are all but invisible, and the two little pointed
swallow-tails, just touching the plant’s stem with their
mutual tip, make the stalk of the leaf. Even on the wall
of a room or a curtain it would seem as though a dead leaf
were sticking there; how much more when, as is always
the case, the butterfly flies into some bush or thicket
crowded with dry, brown leaves, and settles all amongst
them. It is not that you don’t see it there that makes
you miss it, but that you see it and scores of brown
leaves all about it, every one of which looks just the same
as itself.</p>

<p><span class='small'>PROTECTIVE MIMICRY</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c002'>The picture at the top shows birds pursuing butterflies, while in the one below the same birds
have lost their prey, as the butterflies have alighted and show only the underside of their
wings, which are practically indistinguishable from the neighbouring leaves.</p>

<p class='c015'>To make the matter plainer, in case this is not a very
accurate description, here is the account of an eye-witness:
“This species,” says Dr. Wallace, “was not uncommon
in dry woods and thickets, and I often endeavoured
to capture it without success, for after flying a
short distance it would enter a bush among dry or dead
<a id='Page_257'></a>leaves, and however carefully I crept up to the spot, I
could never discover it till it would suddenly dart out
again, and then disappear in a similar place. At length
I was fortunate enough to see the exact spot where the
butterfly settled, and though I lost sight of it for some
time, I at length discovered that it was close before my
eyes, but that in its position of repose it so closely resembled
a dead leaf attached to a twig as almost certainly
to deceive the eye, even when gazing full upon it.”
Then follows a minute explanation of the imposture.
“The end of the upper wings terminates in a fine point,
just as the leaves of many tropical shrubs and trees are
pointed, while the lower wings are somewhat more obtuse,
and are lengthened out into a short, thick tail. Between
these two points there runs a dark, curved line exactly representing
the midrib of a leaf, and from this radiate on
each side a few oblique marks, which well imitate the
lateral veins. The tint of the under surface varies much,
but it is always some ashy brown or reddish colour, which
matches with those of dead leaves. The habit of the
species is always to rest on a twig and among dead or dry
leaves, and in this position, with the wings closely
pressed together, their outline is exactly that of a moderately-sized
leaf, slightly curved or shrivelled. The tail of
the hind wings forms a perfect stalk, and touches the
stick, while the insect is supported by the middle pair of
legs, which are not noticed among the twigs and fibres
that surround it. The head and antennæ are drawn back
between the wings, so as to be quite concealed, and there
is a little notch hollowed out at the very base of the
<a id='Page_258'></a>wings, which allows the head to be retracted sufficiently.
All these varied details combine to produce a disguise
that is so complete and marvellous as to astonish everyone
who observes it, and the habits of the insect are such
as to utilise all these peculiarities, and render them available
in such a manner as to remove all doubt of the purpose
of this singular case of mimicry, which is undoubtedly
a protection to the insect. Its strong and swift flight is
sufficient to save it from its enemies when on the wing,
but if it were equally conspicuous when at rest it could
not long escape extinction, owing to the attacks of the
insectivorous birds and reptiles that abound in the tropical
forests.”<a id='r104'></a><a href='#f104' class='c016'><sup>[104]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c017'>Dr. Wallace then speaks of another closely allied
species which is common in India, on the under surface of
whose wings there are sometimes, to the boot of all that
has been described, in the way of disguise, “patches and
spots formed of small black dots, so closely resembling the
way in which minute fungi grow on leaves that it is
almost impossible, at first, not to believe that fungi have
grown on the butterflies themselves.”<a href='#f104' class='c016'><sup>[104]</sup></a> The minuteness of
a resemblance like this is really very surprising, for it
seems as though the butterfly-hunting bird or insect—some
powerful wasp may represent the latter—was capable
of minutely examining the object in question, and saying
to itself, as it were, “I don’t think that can be a leaf, because
there are no black spots upon it,” or <i><span lang="la">vice versâ</span></i>. In
reality, however, it is no doubt the general effect, to which
every detail contributes, that tells. What such resemblances
do seem to me to show—and this, I think, is a new
<a id='Page_259'></a>idea—is the accuracy and precision of some insects’ sight.
How insects see things has long been a question, and
many, I suppose, think it quite uncertain whether a leaf,
for instance, throws the same picture on their retina that
it does on ours. But if, to deceive them, the copy must
be such that it also deceives us, is it not clear that it does?
Otherwise the effect of the original could probably be
reproduced by a less accurate copy. How little, after all,
does the finest painting really resemble nature! The
effect alone does so, not the means by which it is arrived
at. Surely, then, if an insect, looking at a leaf or any
other object, received but a general impression of colour,
with an outline more or less blurred, or ill-defined, these
copies of nature by nature—made to deceive—would bear
witness to the fact. A study of protective resemblances
is perhaps the best way of forming an idea as to how
creatures, other than ourselves, see the world. It is even
possible that such resemblances exist, which we, because
we see things differently, are totally incapable of detecting.</p>

<p class='c017'>I do not know if any other striking case of resemblance
to an inanimate object (if plant life can be included under
this term) is offered by the butterfly world, though there
are several more of the same kind, but I cannot remember
one just now. No doubt there are many which have not
yet been discovered. We have, however, various instances
of concealment even here in England, as, for instance, the
peacock butterfly; but these, as well as special resemblances,
are, for the most part, more marked in moths.
The lappet moth, indeed, though it does not quite get
<a id='Page_260'></a>the shape, looks very like a dead brown leaf, whilst in the
buff-tip moth we are supposed to have a special resemblance
to a piece of rotting wood, clothed with moss
or lichen, and broken at each end. Personally, I have
never received the impression of such a definite object, but
only a general one of rot and decay. Even here, however,
I do not believe I could ever be taken in, for the yellow
head and tips of the wings, which are supposed to offer
a perfect resemblance to the two broken ends of the piece
of wood, are to me the tell-tale parts, and instantly
cry out, “Moth!” In fact, soft as is the colouring of
the buff-tip, it still seems to me a salient object, and
I do not think very much of that bird’s eyesight who
fails to detect it under anything like favourable circumstances.</p>

<p class='c017'>Another moth that flies by day, and is not uncommon
in the United States, bears, when sitting on
a leaf, a much stronger resemblance to a bird-dropping,
but in this not uncommon form of imitation moths, and
all other insects, are outdone by spiders, who use it
aggressively against them, and particularly, it would
seem, against butterflies, as the following instances will
show. Mr. Forbes once, whilst travelling in Java, saw
a butterfly settled upon a bird-dropping. He watched
it for some time, and then, wondering at its long stay,
approached cautiously, and, slowly extending his hand,
actually caught it by its wings, between his finger and
thumb—no mean feat, as it seemed, yet there was nothing
to boast of. As he lifted the butterfly only the wings
came away, the rest of it staying with the supposed bird-dropping,
<a id='Page_261'></a>which was now seen to be a spider, who, having
caught the butterfly by means of this shameful imposture,
was quietly occupied in eating it. The disguise in this
case was of the most wonderful perfection. “Such
excreta,” says Mr. Forbes, who discovered this one, “consist
of a central and denser portion of a pure white, chalk-like
colour, streaked here and there with black, and
surrounded by a thin border of the dried-up, more fluid
part.”<a id='r105'></a><a href='#f105' class='c016'><sup>[105]</sup></a> The appearance of each of these constituent
parts was successfully counterfeited by the spider in
question, who, in its own person, represented the more
solid material, and spun the rest with its web.</p>

<p class='c017'>As I know from early experience, when a naturalist makes
a prize, all at once, of some interesting specimen, for some
time afterwards he expects, or, rather, feels as if he would
see some other on every leaf or twig; but time went by
and no more of these “vain, delusive” spiders presented
themselves. At length, years afterwards, the
same naturalist found himself by the banks of the Moesi
river, in Sumatra (which sounds much more interesting
than the Thames, for instance), and this was his second
experience. “I was,” he says, “rather dreamily looking
on the shrubs before me, when I became conscious of my
eyes resting on a bird-excreta-marked leaf. How strange,
I thought, it is that I have never got another specimen of
that curious spider I found in Java, which simulated a
patch just like this! I plucked the leaf by the petiole
while so cogitating and looked at it half-listlessly for
some moments, mentally remarking how closely that other
spider had copied nature, when, to my delighted surprise,
<a id='Page_262'></a>I discovered that I had actually secured a second specimen,
but the imitation was so exquisite that I really did not
perceive how matters stood for several moments. The
spider never moved while I was plucking or twirling the
leaf, and it was only when I placed the tip of my little
finger on it that I observed that it was a spider, when
it, without any displacement of itself, flashed its falces into
my flesh.”<a href='#f105' class='c016'><sup>[105]</sup></a> (He means it bit him.)</p>

<p class='c017'>Not all butterflies are entrapped by the kind of simulacrum
here noticed. Nature can adapt herself to every
taste, and in South Africa there are spiders who make
themselves attractive by appearing to be flowers. Of
some of these and their <i><span lang="la">modus operandi</span></i> Mr. Rowland
Trimen, who was curator of the Cape Town Museum,
gives the following interesting account: “Many species of
spiders,” he says, “are well adapted to succeed by being
coloured in resemblance to the flowers in or on which
they await the arrival of their victims. One that inhabits
Cape Town is of the exact rose-red of the flowers
of the oleander, and, to more effectually conceal it, the
palpi, top of the cephalothorax, and four lateral stripes
on the abdomen, are white, according remarkably with
the irregular white markings so frequent on the petals of
<i><span lang="la">Nerium</span></i>.”<a id='r106'></a><a href='#f106' class='c016'><sup>[106]</sup></a> These, indeed, must be beautiful spiders, and
one would like to hear a little more of them, but Mr.
Trimen goes at once from red to yellow. “I was led,” he
continues, “to notice a yellow spider of the same group
in consequence of seeing that two of a number of butterflies
on the flowers of <i><span lang="la">Senecio pulugera</span></i> did not, on my
approach, fly off with their companions. Each of these
<a id='Page_263'></a>unfortunates turned out to be in the clutches of a spider,
and when I released them I observed their captors very
narrowly, and I found that the latter’s close resemblance
to the <i><span lang="la">Senecio</span></i> flowers was not one of colour alone, but
due also to attitude. This spider, holding on to the flower
stalk by the two hinder pairs of legs, extended the two
long front pairs upward and laterally. In this position it
was scarcely possible to believe that it was not a flower
seen in profile, the rounded abdomen representing the
central mass of florets and the extended legs the ray
florets, while to complete the illusion the femora of
the front pair of legs, adpressed to the thorax, have each
a longitudinal red stripe, which represents the ferruginous
stripe on the sepals of the flower.”<a href='#f106' class='c016'><sup>[106]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c017'>Later on, Mr. Trimen was so fortunate as actually to
see a butterfly caught by another flowery impostor:—“The
butterfly,” he tells us, “was engaged in honey-sucking
on a white flower-head of <i><span lang="la">Lantana</span></i>, and explored each
individual flower with its proboscis. While I was watching
it, the butterfly touched and partly walked over what
looked like a slightly folded or crumpled flower about the
middle of the cluster. This turned out to be a spider,
which instantly seized the butterfly, throwing forward its
front legs, somewhat after the fashion of a mantis. In
this spider the effect of the little depressions on the limb
of the corolla was given by some depressed lines on the
back of its smooth white abdomen.”<a href='#f106' class='c016'><sup>[106]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c017'>Other spiders resemble snail-shells, others ants, and one,
at least, is like a small scorpion, but we will return to the
butterflies. As I have said, except for that wonderful
<a id='Page_264'></a>copy of a leaf, already described, I cannot think of any very
extraordinary resemblances amongst them, belonging to
that class, but there are others which form a little class
of their own. In the last chapter we have seen bees
imitating bees, and in this we will make the acquaintance
of certain butterflies which, as it were, pretend to be of
a species which they do not really belong to. Thus in
Brazil, by the great River Amazons, a number of large
showy butterflies are found which belong to the family of
the <i><span lang="la">Heliconea</span></i>, and wherever these fly they are accompanied
by various other butterflies, belonging to quite
different families, which are nevertheless so extremely like
them that even Mr. Bates, who, for eleven years, ran up
and down the Amazons with a butterfly-net in his hand,
could never be quite sure which kind it was that he was
going to catch. Often, when he thought he had got a
<i><span lang="la">Heliconea</span></i> he was perfectly thunderstruck to find it was
really a <i><span lang="la">Papilio</span></i>, <i><span lang="la">Pieris</span></i>, <i><span lang="la">Euterpe</span></i>, <i><span lang="la">Leptalis</span></i>, <i><span lang="la">Protogonius</span></i>,
<i><span lang="la">Ithoneis</span></i>, <i><span lang="la">Dioptis</span></i>, <i><span lang="la">Pericopis</span></i>, <i><span lang="la">Hyelosia</span></i>, or something of that
sort; or again, when it was one of these he was after, and
at last he thought he had it in the net, he would be
petrified, on looking more closely, to find that what he
had really caught was a <i><span lang="la">Heliconea</span></i>.</p>

<p class='c017'>But now, as all these butterflies were alike or nearly
alike, how could Mr. Bates tell—or how had anybody
been able to tell before him—that they were really not
all the same species—that a <i><span lang="la">Heliconea</span></i> was not a <i><span lang="la">Papilio</span></i>,
or that a <i><span lang="la">Papilio</span></i>, <i><span lang="la">Pieris</span></i>, <i><span lang="la">Euterpe</span></i>, etc., were not all of
them <i><span lang="la">Heliconeas</span></i>? This, at first sight, seems a difficult
question to answer, but really it is not, because, in all
<a id='Page_265'></a>these families of butterflies, the various species composing
them bear a kind of generalised resemblance to one
another: there is a family likeness, in fact, and this is
not only the case in regard to their outward appearance—the
shape and colour of their wings, etc.—but it applies,
in a still greater degree, to their structure and internal
economy. Thus, however strongly a <i><span lang="la">Pieris</span></i>, or one of
those others, might resemble a <i><span lang="la">Heliconea</span></i>, the trained eye
of an entomologist could easily see that it really was a
member of another family, and since, in resembling the
<i><span lang="la">Heliconea</span></i>, it departed from the general type of pattern
and colouring exhibited by the family to which it belonged,
whilst this one species of <i><span lang="la">Heliconea</span></i> it resembled
was like the others, it might be inferred that the latter
was the imitated and not the imitating form. Again—and
this is still more decisive evidence in the cases
where it applies—the resemblance is often confined to
one sex of the copying species, viz. the female, so that
whilst she is hardly to be distinguished from the model
on which she has founded herself, the male retains the
appearance, together with all the other characteristics, of
the race to which both he and she belong.</p>

<p class='c017'>But now came a further question, the most puzzling
or, at any rate, the most important one of all, viz. Why
should the one butterfly imitate, or rather resemble the
other, in such an extraordinary degree—a degree seeming
to preclude the possibility of mere chance having brought
it about? This question Mr. Bates is supposed to have
been the first to answer, though I cannot help thinking,
myself, that he has only extended an explanation, which,
<a id='Page_266'></a>in some cases, was so obvious that no one had thought
of pointing it out, to these other cases where it was not
nearly so easy to see. For what can be plainer, as Mr.
Bates himself remarks, than that a moth, for instance, by
closely resembling a hornet, would escape the attacks of
birds that might otherwise have devoured it? I cannot
think but that so patent an explanation had been in the
minds of many long before 1862, and though no one previous
to that date may have applied the principle of
natural selection to such cases, it must be remembered
that natural selection had been established by Darwin
some ten or twelve years before.</p>

<p class='c017'>Bates, however, besides making an ingenious application
of the above principle to a special case, gave a real reason
for something which was not at all obvious, viz. why one
butterfly should be a gainer by closely resembling another;
and this no one had hitherto been able to do. His
surmise, which has since in many instances been confirmed,
is as follows. Having first pointed out that the
<i><span lang="la">Heliconea</span></i> butterflies are a numerous, flourishing race,
whilst those species that imitate them are poor in numbers,
he says, “What advantages the <i><span lang="la">Heliconidæ</span></i> possess
to make them so flourishing a group, and, consequently,
the object of so much mimetic resemblance, it is not easy
to discover. There is nothing apparent in their structure
or habits which could render them safe from persecution
by the numerous insectivorous animals which are constantly
on the watch in the same parts of the forest which
they inhabit. It is probable they are unpalatable to
insect enemies. Some of them have glands near the end
<a id='Page_267'></a>of the abdomen which they protrude when roughly handled;
it is well known that similar organs in other families
secrete fetid liquids or gases and that these serve as a protection
to the species. They have all a peculiar smell. I
never saw the flocks of slow-flying <i><span lang="la">Heliconidæ</span></i> in the
woods persecuted by birds or dragon-flies, to which they
would have been easy prey; nor when at rest on leaves
did they appear to be molested by lizards, or the predaceous
flies which were very often seen pouncing on
butterflies of other families. If they owe their flourishing
existence to this cause it would be intelligible why species
whose scanty number of individuals reveals a less protected
condition, should be disguised in their dress, and thus
share their immunity. Is it not probable, seeing the
excessive abundance of the one species and the fewness of
individuals of the other, that the <i><span lang="la">Heliconea</span></i> is free from
the persecution to which the <i><span lang="la">Leptalis</span></i> is subjected?”<a id='r107'></a><a href='#f107' class='c016'><sup>[107]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c017'>No sooner was this suggestion made than naturalists all
over the world began to test it, or rather to say that it
ought to be tested. Some experiments have been made,
but they have not been very numerous, and it can hardly
be said that they entirely support Bates’s view. Sometimes
they do and sometimes they do not, so as there
is no reason to suppose that every butterfly is relished
by every kind of insect-eating creature, this is not conclusive,
till the same tests are employed in regard to butterflies
that are not imitated in this way; for if the latter
have not been imitated on that account, it need not
be on that account that others have been imitated.
Thus Belt says, as the result of his observations, “The
<a id='Page_268'></a><i><span lang="la">Heliconidæ</span></i> are distasteful to most animals; I have seen
even spiders drop them out of their webs again; and small
monkeys, which are extremely fond of insects, will not eat
them, as I have proved over and over again.”<a id='r108'></a><a href='#f108' class='c016'><sup>[108]</sup></a> He also
“observed a pair of birds that were bringing butterflies
and dragon-flies to their young, and although the <i><span lang="la">Heliconidæ</span></i>
swarmed in the neighbourhood, and are of weak
flight so as to be easily caught, the birds never brought
one to their nest.”<a id='r109'></a><a href='#f109' class='c016'><sup>[109]</sup></a> This seems very good evidence of
the truth of Bates’s theory, but then, as against it, we
learn from the same observer that “another spider that
frequented flowers seemed to be fond of these very same
butterflies,” and as to the spiders which were seen to drop
them out of their webs, they may resolve themselves into
one, since farther on Belt says, “A large species of spider
also used to drop them out of its web when I put them into
it.”<a href='#f109' class='c016'><sup>[109]</sup></a> Then we are told that “there is, however, a yellow and
black-banded wasp that catches them to store his nest
with”; and which, having done so, “would quietly bite
off its wings, roll it up into a ball, and fly off with it.”<a id='r110'></a><a href='#f110' class='c016'><sup>[110]</sup></a>
Professor Poulton calls these cases “interesting exceptions,”
and easily accounts for them. But might not
further observation keep adding to the number of exceptions,
until at last, they become so numerous that all
one could say would be this: “There is a great choice
of insects in tropical America, and some creatures may
prefer one kind and some another, to whatever species they
belong.” In India, again, where there is another family of
butterflies having doubles, or understudies, only one
species was refused by all the mantids which a French
<a id='Page_269'></a>naturalist gave them to. Others were eaten by all of
them.</p>

<p class='c017'>Has any man tried eating one of these butterflies?
That was what Professor Wheeler did to test another supposed
case of the same sort. Here the insect was a large
and very conspicuously coloured day-flying moth. This
moth has not an understudy, as far as is known, but it
was supposed, then, to be an example of what is called
“warning coloration,” that is to say, its bright colours
were believed to be flourished in the face of any and
every animal it might meet with, in order to warn them
that it was not good to eat. Otherwise some bird, or
lizard, or other creature might kill it before it had time to
find out that it wasn’t. For instance, had it been just a
brown moth—there are so many of these and most of them
good to eat—how was it to be distinguished from others?
But such a get-up as <i>that</i>—black and white wings and a
black and orange body—once seen it was not to be forgotten.
It was like the red flag at a rifle range, warning one off,
and this is the theory of warning coloration. So Professor
Wheeler, as he rode through the deserts of Wyoming,
with the moths all about him, resolved to test this theory
which had lived for a long time, and still goes on living a
good deal on trust. “He dismounted from his horse and
proceeded to masticate the body of one of the moths. To
his astonishment the little flavour that it contained was
mild and pleasant, one may almost say nut-like.”<a id='r111'></a><a href='#f111' class='c016'><sup>[111]</sup></a> Perhaps
it may be thought that, on the “<i><span lang="la">de gustibus</span></i>” principle,
what is pleasant to a human being might be disagreeable to
a bird or a lizard; but Professor Wheeler tried another
<a id='Page_270'></a>experiment. “Another day-flying moth, common in our
eastern States, has deep black wings, each adorned with a
pair of large yellow spots, and there is a dash of orange
on its legs. It certainly cannot be a mimetic species (if it
were, of course, one would not expect it to be nasty) as
there is no other day-flying moth which could serve as its
model. Several of these moths were given to some lizards
that had previously been well fed on house-flies and could
not, therefore, be very hungry. The moths were seized at
once, and devoured, with evident signs of relish.”<a href='#f111' class='c016'><sup>[111]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c017'>As a result of these experiments Professor Wheeler
concludes that “naturalists should be more careful in
imputing nauseous or disagreeable qualities to some conspicuously
coloured animals,” and he suggests that “if
every field entomologist could only bring himself to
repeat the writer’s experiment on one of many cases of
‘flaunted nauseousness’ and place his taste impressions
on record, we should in the course of time have a really
valuable body of evidence, for we can hardly assume that
beasts, birds, and reptiles can find things ‘nauseous’
which are quite tasteless, or even pleasant, to the human
palate.”<a href='#f111' class='c016'><sup>[111]</sup></a> “<i><span lang="fr">Il n’y a pas de réplique à cela</span></i>,” and how it is
that so simple a plan did not occur to Mr. Bates during
all the eleven years he was on the Amazon it is not very
easy to imagine. On the whole, perhaps, it may be said
that the reason why certain butterflies are imitated by
other butterflies has not been so satisfactorily settled as
the fact that they are so imitated. But, on the other
hand, there is some—perhaps much—evidence of the
truth of Bates’s theory, and, moreover, that theory is in
<a id='Page_271'></a>itself so plausible that it seems to require a good deal of
evidence to overthrow it.</p>

<p class='c017'>It is not only in South America that butterflies dress
up like one another. Instances similar to those here
given occur also in Africa and the Malay Archipelago, as
well as in other parts of the world. There is even one
doubtful case in England, both the copy and original
being moths. Moths, especially the day-flying ones, are
represented in these phenomena as well as butterflies,
which are sometimes imitated by them.</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_2_0_4 c015'>THOUGH the principle of protective resemblance, as
explained in the last chapter, will account for the
colours and markings of those butterflies which
imitate the <i><span lang="la">Heliconidæ</span></i>, it does not explain how the
<i><span lang="la">Heliconidæ</span></i> themselves came to be as they are; for in
nature every mark and line and shade has a meaning, and
has come into existence by virtue of some law or another.
Beauty itself, independently of any <i><span lang="fr">arrière pensée</span></i>, as we
may call it—remembering those flower-resembling spiders—requires
to be explained.</p>

<p class='c017'>Nor are the <i><span lang="la">Heliconidæ</span></i> themselves, though gaudily
dressed showy butterflies, anything like so beautiful as
many others; for instance, as the <i><span lang="la">Morphos</span></i>, those giants of
their kind, who sweep like stars through the tropical
forests on wings whose whole broad surface is blue, but a
blue that flashes like a drawn sword and has a hundred
glints and gleamings of ever-varying light. High-fliers
they are for the most part, keeping to the tops of the trees,
<a id='Page_273'></a>but every morning, and always at the same time, they
make a descent into the glades and alleys of the forest,
where for a little they flap lazily backwards and forwards,
now in eclipse, now flashing forth into sunlight, as though
to flaunt their beauties in the face of the lower world.
Such openings in the primeval forest are often made by
the fall of great trees—for even where the axe is not
there is death in the midst of life—and as these majestic
insects sail high above them in a world of air and light,
their shadows fall upon the place beneath, and trace their
course along the ground. When the sun’s rays strike into
them, such clearings become the gathering grounds of
various butterflies. Besides the great <i><span lang="la">Morphos</span></i>, the flashing
of whose wings in the sunlight can be seen sometimes
a quarter of a mile away,<a id='r112'></a><a href='#f112' class='c016'><sup>[112]</sup></a> various species of <i><span lang="la">Heliconeas</span></i>—the
one we have just been reading about—whose black
wings are in some species spotted with scarlet, in others
with white or blue, waltz about the bushes or undergrowth,
“dancing in the chequered shade”; fritillaries somewhat
like our own, but of larger size and more effective colouring,
fly higher up, about the tree-trunks, whilst over the
ground itself, carpeted as it often is with flowers fallen
from the leafy world above, and scenting the air, ghost-like
butterflies, whose clear, transparent wings are without
any colouring matter, ceaselessly hover and flit.</p>

<p class='c017'>Wherever there is a river, many-coloured armies,
bivouacked amidst its various shoals and reefs, sit sucking
water through, the moist particles of the sand, whilst
others, in even greater numbers, pass and repass from one
bank to another, making, however wide the waterway, an
<a id='Page_274'></a>aerial fluttering bridge. Other butterflies, also denizens
of the great Brazilian or Central American forests, have
broad white wings, shot with a satiny lustre, whilst those
of yet another are like glass, with one opaque spot of
violet and blue, in the midst of each of them. In flight
this spot is the only part that can be seen, and it looks,
Bates tells us, “like the wandering petal of a flower.”<a id='r113'></a><a href='#f113' class='c016'><sup>[113]</sup></a>
There are swallow-tailed butterflies, too, whose livery of
deep, soft green, and deeper velvet black, set off with
roseate hues, is amongst the richest of all—“rich, not
gaudy,” so at least I should term it, for I have seen
it, putting flowers to shame, on the lower slopes of the
Himalayas. Here these butterflies—double the size of
our <i><span lang="la">Machaon</span></i>, and of another shape, with racquet-rather
than swallow-tails, flew on the open hillside, courting
the sun, but in Brazil they keep to the forest depths,
where, like Una, they “make a sunshine in the shady
place.”</p>

<p class='c017'>The butterflies of South America are almost rivalled—quite
they cannot be—by those of the Malay Archipelago.
Here we have the great Bird-winged Butterfly, discovered
by Dr. Wallace, who calls it “elegant,” and bestows upon it
a name (<i><span lang="la">Ornithoptera Brookeana</span></i>) which is not quite that.<a id='r114'></a><a href='#f114' class='c016'><sup>[114]</sup></a>
However, “What’s in a name? That which we call a
<i>Brookeana</i>,” etc.—we must reverse the proposition. There
is no describing such a creature—at least, not convincingly.
Suffice it to say that its wings “almost resemble those of
a sphinx moth in shape,” and are deep, velvety black, but
lit up with a band of green feather-like markings, so
brilliant and lovely that they reminded its discoverer
<a id='Page_275'></a>“of the wing-coverts of the Mexican trogon laid upon
velvet”<a href='#f114' class='c016'><sup>[114]</sup></a>—and that for anyone who has seen a trogon,
even stuffed and dried, is to say enough. Besides this
adornment the great <i>Brookeana</i> has “a broad neck-collar
of vivid crimson and a few delicate white touches
on the outer margins of the hind wings.”<a href='#f114' class='c016'><sup>[114]</sup></a> Another
<i><span lang="la">Ornithoptera</span></i> without the <i>Brookeana</i> is “the largest, the
most perfect, and the most beautiful of butterflies.”
The two last, however, are matter of opinion, and I
should think myself that a <i><span lang="la">Morpho</span></i> with its azure wings,
sometimes seven inches across, and flashing a quarter
of a mile away, would run—or fly—it hard. Then
there is a yet more gorgeous species of “Bird-winged
Butterfly,” with wings equalling or even exceeding the
<i><span lang="la">Morpho’s</span></i> in expanse, whose ample surface is divided between
flame-like orange and a black so deep, rich, and
velvety that it seems to glow—“the pride of the Eastern
tropics, one of the most gorgeously coloured butterflies in
the world.”<a id='r115'></a><a href='#f115' class='c016'><sup>[115]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c017'>This was the butterfly that gave Dr. Wallace a headache,
“so great was the excitement produced by what
will appear to most people a very inadequate cause.”<a href='#f115' class='c016'><sup>[115]</sup></a>
Surely not; for the cause here alluded to was not the
insect’s beauty—which had been seen before, free and
untrammelled, without any such ill-consequence—but its
capture and anticipated transference to the cyanide
bottle. It was not mere æsthetic emotion, therefore,
that produced the headache, but scientific enthusiasm, of
which no man need feel ashamed. It is easy for us on
such occasions to mistake our feelings, but the clue to
<a id='Page_276'></a>them, I think, is this, that however beautiful a creature
may be, and however appreciative we may think ourselves
of such beauty, yet if we resolve, in the true interests of
science, to take that creature’s life, then the scientific
spirit must be far stronger in us than mere admiration
of its beauty. This test I would apply to another
account which Dr. Wallace gives us of the capture of
“one of the most magnificent insects that the world
contains.” “I trembled,” he says, “with excitement as
I saw it coming majestically towards me, and could
hardly believe I had really succeeded in my stroke till I
had taken it out of the net and was gazing, lost in
admiration, at the velvet black and brilliant green of its
wings—seven inches across—its golden body, and crimson
breast. It is true I had seen similar insects in cabinets at
home, but it is quite another thing to capture such oneself—to
feel it struggling between one’s fingers, and to gaze
upon its fresh and living beauty, a bright gem shining
out amid the silent gloom of a dark and tangled forest.
The village of Dobbo held that evening at least one
contented man.”<a id='r116'></a><a href='#f116' class='c016'><sup>[116]</sup></a> When we consider that the “fresh
and living beauty” was caught for the very sake of being
made dead and mouldy, and that the “bright gem” which
would otherwise have continued to flash in the forest was
about to become one of those very same specimens that
had been looked at with such an inferior degree of
interest, we must admit, I think, that the higher of two
passions was predominant here, and that the author, in
dwelling only upon the other and lower one—mere delight
of the eye—has done himself less than justice.</p>

<p class='c017'><a id='Page_277'></a>Mr. Bates, without headaches, has given us some very
pleasing pictures of butterfly-life in the tropics, and in
doing so he has instinctively, as it were, kept the killing
and capturing in the background. “The number and
variety of gaily-tinted butterflies,” he tells us, “sporting
about in this grove on sunny days, were so great that the
bright moving flakes of colour gave quite a character to
the physiognomy of the place. It was impossible to walk
far without disturbing flocks of them from the damp sand
at the edge of the water, where they congregate to imbibe
the moisture. They were of almost all colours,
sizes, and shapes. I noticed here altogether eighty species
belonging to twenty-two different genera. It is a singular
fact that, with very few exceptions, all the individuals of
these various species thus sporting in sunny places were
of the male sex; their partners, which are much more
soberly dressed and immensely less numerous than the
males, being confined to the shades of the woods. Every
afternoon, as the sun was getting low, I used to notice
these gaudy, sunshine-loving swains trooping off to the
forest, where I suppose they would find their sweethearts
and wives.”<a id='r117'></a><a href='#f117' class='c016'><sup>[117]</sup></a> What a delightful scene! Here, “next to
the very common sulphur-yellow and orange-coloured
kinds, the most abundant were about a dozen species of
<i><span lang="la">Eunica</span></i>, of large size, conspicuous from their liveries of
glossy dark blue and purple. A superbly adorned creature,
the <i><span lang="la">Callithea Markii</span></i>, having wings of a thick texture,
coloured sapphire blue and orange, was only an occasional
visitor. On certain days, when the weather was very
calm, two small gilded green species literally swarmed on
<a id='Page_278'></a>the sands, their glittering wings lying wide open on the
flat surface.”<a href='#f117' class='c016'><sup>[117]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c017'>Such, then, are the colours of butterflies, and, as may
be imagined, comparatively few of these gorgeous liveries
have been acquired through the principle of protective
resemblance—using the term in its widest sense, to include
those cases where one species becomes, as it were,
the double or wraith of another. Mimicry is the word
which, by a ludicrous process of false reasoning, naturalists
have convinced themselves it is right to apply to this
particular kind of resemblance, and no other one; though
why a butterfly should <i>mimic</i> another butterfly and only
<i>resemble</i> a leaf, “<i><span lang="es">quien sabe?</span></i>” as the Spaniards say. The
principal reason adduced for this misuse of language, viz.
that the wrong word is more convenient than any right
one, providing us with the useful series, <i>mimic</i>, <i>mimicry</i>,
<i>mimetic</i>, <i>mimicker</i>, <i>mimicked</i>, <i>mimicking</i>, obviously applies
to the one case as well as the other, and if it is an
advantage to be absurd in one way, surely it is a double
one to be absurd in two. On these grounds I would
suggest to naturalists that, having broken down the
proper and natural confinements of the word in question,
they should rather extend its use than limit it, to the
extent even of calling their children “mimetic forms,”
should they happen to resemble them, and thinking twice
before punishing a son for merely “mimicking” his
father.</p>

<p class='c017'>But, leaving this, how—to take the jargon as one finds
it—are the glorious colours of butterflies to be explained
when they are due neither to protective resemblance,
<a id='Page_279'></a>which is not mimicry, though it very much resembles
it, nor to mimicry, which is distinct from protective
resemblance, though mimicking it exactly? Certainly
neither of these will do to account for uncopied hues
and patterns, which are like nothing in the world but
their own loveliness, unless, indeed, it be the rival
glories of the most resplendent birds. Still less will
aggressive resemblance—though, as we see, it can make
spiders look like flowers—explain them. The great
governing cause which produces such effects as these, as
well as most others in nature, is natural selection;
but we must look beyond natural selection even, if we
wish to understand all the beauty that we see in the
animal world, and especially the higher developments
of it.</p>

<p class='c017'>Darwin, as we know, was the great demonstrator—though
not the first conceiver—of the law of natural selection,<a id='r118'></a><a href='#f118' class='c016'><sup>[118]</sup></a>
and on this he might have cried “<i><span lang="la">Nunc dimittis</span></i>”
and retired, so to speak, leaving someone else to find out
the other law; but instead of that he went on and
demonstrated that too. This other law, the evidence
for which is really overwhelming, and has never been met
<a id='Page_280'></a>by anything better than a conceited over-estimation of
human superiority, wrapped up in a cloud of wrong
reasoning, is that of sexual selection, which implies that,
in the choice of their mates, animals, like ourselves, are
guided by some sort of preference; and as this with them—again
like ourselves—is usually determined by the
element of beauty, the most beautiful partners are being
constantly selected, and species in consequence become
more and more beautiful. This process, however, is
usually confined to the males, they being the eager
wooers, whilst the females only wait to be courted, and
then shyly and modestly choose—such, at least, is the
supposition. This masculine beauty is often inherited by
that sex only to which it is so useful, but in other cases
it is transmitted to the female also. Thus, to take birds,
where the results of the law of sexual selection are on
the whole most pronounced, we have, on the one hand,
the pheasants and birds of paradise, where the male alone
is resplendent, whilst in the trogons, parrots, and many
other species the beauty is common to both the sexes.
As is well known, the males of various highly ornate
birds are accustomed to make the most extraordinary
display of their beauty before the females, making the
most of the parts most richly decorated, assuming just
such attitudes as are required in order to give these their
full advantage, and, in fact, taking pains and trouble in
a high degree and of a very special and peculiar kind,
which must either be directed to an end which seems
perfectly plain and apparent, or else so much waste of
time—due to no special cause and without any particular
<a id='Page_281'></a>meaning—an alternative which the opponents of sexual
selection do not in the least mind accepting.</p>

<p class='c017'>To give one instance of what is called nuptial display
in birds—for it will serve to illustrate what Darwin
supposes to take place with some insects also, as well as
forming a basis of comparison with what has been more
carefully observed in the case of spiders—Belt in his often
quoted work gives us the following pretty picture of
humming-bird courtship. Speaking of a beautiful blue,
green, and white species (<i><span lang="la">Florisuga mellivora</span></i>), he says:
“I have seen the female sitting quietly on a branch, and
two males displaying their charms in front of her. One
would shoot up like a rocket, then suddenly expanding
the snow-white tail like an inverted parachute, slowly
descend in front of her, turning round gradually to show
off both back and front. The effect was heightened by
the wings being invisible from a distance of a few yards,
both from their great velocity of movement and from not
having the metallic lustre of the rest of the body. The
expanded white tail covered more space than all the rest
of the bird, and was evidently the grand feature in the
performance. Whilst one was descending, the other
would shoot up and come slowly down expanded. The
entertainment would end in a fight between the two performers;
but whether the most beautiful or the most
pugnacious was the accepted suitor I know not.”<a id='r119'></a><a href='#f119' class='c016'><sup>[119]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c017'>Here the display, as well as the intention, seems evident
enough, and it is not a whit more so than in hundreds of
other cases collected by Darwin during his lifetime, and
which have been largely added to since his death. As
<a id='Page_282'></a>the hen is constantly present during these performances,
and as she has been known on various occasions to show
a strong partiality, or the reverse, to this or that male
bird, we have here a solid basis of observed fact on which
to raise an hypothesis. On what facts the counter one
rests, as propounded by Dr. Wallace, viz. that colour and
antics are produced by superior vigour resident in the
male, it is less easy to see, unless, indeed, such as point in
a quite opposite direction may, on a sort of <i>lucus a non
lucendo</i> principle, be held to support it. If this be conceded,
then, indeed, we have a plentiful crop, nor need we
any longer feel sceptical because the eagle, say—that bird
of fierce energy—does not flash out like all the crown
jewels together as it descends on its prey, or because the
swift, whose vital force is, perhaps, even greater, leaves no
train of jewelled light to die all day, behind it, on the air.
Nor need we wonder that the trogons, though as resplendent
as the swifts, swallows<a id='r120'></a><a href='#f120' class='c016'><sup>[120]</sup></a> and eagles are dull-coloured,
should be as lazy and sluggish as these are
energetic: nor that, whereas the females of some humming-birds
are sober-suited, those of others, though their vigour
would seem to be in no way superior, are as gem-like as
their mates: or that the males as well as the females of
some wholly dull-coloured ones, and of many other plain
birds, seem bursting with vigour, and indulge in all sorts
of strange antics and dances: that a cock partridge, for
instance, seems as vigorous as a cock pheasant, and that
bright colours and pugnacity are dissociated in such tremendous
<a id='Page_283'></a>fighters as the ruff, the coot, and the blackcock.
Multiply such instances by the score or the hundred—as
can easily be done—and if only the above-stated principle
be granted, we get more and more proof of the correctness
of a theory to which facts, if dealt with in the more
usual way, would be almost instantly fatal. After all, this
would be a more satisfactory mode of procedure than that
of tolerating a travesty on the strength of a high reputation.
There is such a principle in nature as the <i>lucus
a non lucendo</i> one, so, as we admit the word mimicry in
a false sense—because it is convenient—why not admit
that? It would be not one whit less convenient—for
the theory.</p>

<p class='c017'>But, handling facts in another way, can we explain the
beautiful colours of butterflies as we explain the brilliant
plumage of birds—by sexual selection, that is to say? Of
this there is not so much direct evidence as could be
wished, for butterfly courtship is a long affair, and, for
various reasons, is not so easy to watch under natural
conditions, as in the case of birds, though this, too, is
often beset with difficulties. We know, however, that the
male is often much more beautiful than the female, that
he pirouettes around her, and that she remains often “icy
insensible”—in fact refuses him—which certainly implies
a power of choice. Rival males, too, will “whirl round
each other with the greatest rapidity, and appear to be
incited by the greatest ferocity.”<a id='r121'></a><a href='#f121' class='c016'><sup>[121]</sup></a> That butterflies, like
bees, perceive and are attracted by colours is well known,
and it would be strange, indeed, if they were not alive to
the many very beautiful and complex patterns on their
<a id='Page_284'></a>own wings, when these cannot have been evolved through
any principle of protection—since they resemble or suggest
nothing—when, in fact, if not beauty, it is difficult to see
the object aimed at. Yet the strange suggestion has been
made that, though butterflies see colours, they cannot see
form, that their sight is defective in some peculiar kind
of way. But if form is outline—and if not, what is it?—where
is the distinction, seeing that the beginning
and leaving off of a colour or of two or more colours must
make an outline, and therefore a form? If we see the
colours of a pattern where the one ends and the other
begins, we see that pattern, and on the other hand, if we
could not distinguish one colour from another, or colour
from something uncoloured—as, say, the air—we should be
blind to colour, as well as to form. Form can hardly be
called a thing of itself. It is rather the line of demarcation
between two or more things, so that, if each of these
is clearly perceived, the form or outline which their juxtaposition
makes must be also perceived. Assuming that
butterflies see the beautiful arrangements of colour—eyes,
spots, bands, lines, etc.—in such a way as can alone
account for their being there to see—as well as we do, that
is to say—then it is absurd to imagine that they have no
perception of form.</p>

<p class='c017'>On what is this assertion based? Mr. Scudder relies
on the following facts: “Christy,” he tells us, “observed
in Manitoba one of the swallow-tails fluttering over the
bushes, evidently in search of flowers. As he watched it,
it settled momentarily, and exactly as if it had mistaken
it for a yellow flower, on a twig of <i><span lang="la">Betula glandulosa</span></i>,
<a id='Page_285'></a>bearing withered leaves of a bright yellow colour.”<a id='r122'></a><a href='#f122' class='c016'><sup>[122]</sup></a> But
might not the association of ideas raised by a familiar
colour in an insect’s mind overpower for a moment its
judgment? Might it not do so in the case of a man also?
And should we think a person very stupid who, for a
moment, mistaking a yellow leaf for a yellow flower,
stretched out his hand to pick it? Pooh! once again,<a id='r123'></a><a href='#f123' class='c016'><sup>[123]</sup></a>
let us think of people who do foolish things—kings,
generals, cabinet ministers, servant-maids, etc.—not of
infallible persons. We should not be too severe—not
“break a butterfly on a wheel.”</p>

<p class='c017'>Again—this is Mr. Scudder’s second instance: “Albert
Müller records seeing the blue Alexis of Europe fly
towards a very small bit of pale blue paper lying upon
the grass, and stop within an inch or two of it, as if to
settle, doubtless mistaking it for another of its own
kind.”<a id='r124'></a><a href='#f124' class='c016'><sup>[124]</sup></a> Surely this is rather in favour of the butterfly’s
sight than otherwise, since it discovered its mistake and
did not settle. Who, too, can tell the precise moment
at which the mistake was discovered, since the piece of
blue paper might have puzzled the butterfly—piqued its
curiosity to know what it was—even after it knew what
it was not? Thirdly, “Plateau has observed the small
tortoise-shell butterfly fly rapidly towards a cluster of
artificial flowers.”<a href='#f124' class='c016'><sup>[124]</sup></a> And who cannot be taken in by
artificial flowers? “Such examples as these,” says Mr.
Scudder, “seem to indicate that butterflies may perceive
colour in mass, but in no case indicate any further visual
powers.”<a href='#f124' class='c016'><sup>[124]</sup></a> To me they indicate that butterflies can make
<a id='Page_286'></a>mistakes. Mistakes rarely show one’s perfections, but
other indications of further visual powers are not wanting.
For instance, Mr. Scudder himself says: “One of my
favourite modes of showing this characteristic (inquisitiveness)
to unbelieving friends has been to toss my cap high
in the air, when these butterflies will often dart, dash at,
and play around it as it begins again to descend.”<a href='#f124' class='c016'><sup>[124]</sup></a> How
do they play around this moving object in the air if it
represents to them only “colour in mass,” and not a
defined shape and outline? Were it otherwise, they
would fly right into it, and be carried down with it sometimes
on top of them. But if they see all parts of the
colour so that they can nicely avoid it, and sport about
its periphery, then they see the shape of the cap.
Then, again, Mr. Scudder tells us: “Many kinds are of
a lively and even pugnacious disposition, and perch themselves
upon the tip of a twig, or on a stone, or some such
outlook, and dash at the first butterfly that passes,
<i>especially if it be one of their own species</i>;<a id='r125'></a><a href='#f125' class='c016'><sup>[125]</sup></a> then the
two advance and retreat, forwards and backwards, time
and again, circle round each other with amazing celerity,
all the while, perchance, mounting skywards, until
suddenly they part, dash to the ground, and the now
quiet pursuer again stations himself on the very spot
he quitted for the fray.”<a id='r126'></a><a href='#f126' class='c016'><sup>[126]</sup></a> How does he do <i>that</i> without
accurate eyesight, with good defining power?—to which,
indeed, the whole performance bears witness. Elsewhere,
too, this pronounced characteristic of returning to the
exact spot, left some little time ago, is dwelt upon. To
<a id='Page_287'></a>me it seems a complete upsettal of the defective eyesight
theory, or, since good eyesight could do no more, what
does such defectiveness matter?</p>

<p class='c017'>The following description also, which Bates gives us,
of butterfly-life by the Amazons, does not suggest that
any of these bright-day-lovers, these children of the sun,
need write an “<i><span lang="la">Apologia pro oculis suis</span></i>.” “The fine
showy <i><span lang="la">Heliconii</span></i>,” he says, “often assemble in small parties,
or by twos and threes, apparently to sport together or
perform a kind of dance” (my “dancing in the chequered
shade,” therefore, was no inapt quotation). “I believe the
parties are composed chiefly of males. The sport begins
generally between a single pair. They advance, retire,
glide right and left in face of each other, wheel round
to a considerable distance, again approach, and so on;
a third joins in, then a fourth, or more. <i>They never
touch</i>;<a id='r127'></a><a href='#f127' class='c016'><sup>[127]</sup></a> when too many are congregated a general flutter
takes place, and they all fly off, to fall in again by pairs
shortly afterwards.”<a id='r128'></a><a href='#f128' class='c016'><sup>[128]</sup></a> Lastly, Belt tells us this: “Here
a large spider built strong, yellow, silken webs joined one
on to the other, so as to make a complete curtain of web,
in which were entangled many large butterflies, generally
forest species, caught when flying across the clearing. I was
at first surprised to find that the kinds that frequent open
places were not caught, although they abounded on low
white-flowered shrubs close to the webs; but on getting
behind them and trying to frighten them within the
silken curtain, their instinct taught them to avoid it, for,
although startled, they threaded their way through open
<a id='Page_288'></a>spaces and between the webs with the greatest ease.”<a id='r129'></a><a href='#f129' class='c016'><sup>[129]</sup></a> If
a butterfly with defective eyesight can thread its way
between spiders’ webs, so as never to be caught, “with
the greatest ease,” “why, then, say an old man can do
somewhat”—but it must be without spectacles.</p>

antics and love-dances—Occasional accidents—Strength of the
evidence—The one explanation—Darwin’s last words—His theory
established.</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_2_0_4 c015'>SPIDERS, as we have seen, may attain beauty by
getting more and more like flowers, but beauty
is not the attribute with which they are principally
connected in our minds. Rather they are a synonym
of something uncouth and horrid-looking, as well as of
skill and persevering industry. For those of us, however,
who have lived in the tropics they have other associations,
for here, side by side with the most hideous of
monsters, huge, dark, and hairy, are found others, small
and gem-like, flashing indeed with beauty, the representatives
in their order of the humming-birds, those
“living sunbeams” of the Indians, amongst birds. These
lovely little spiders belong to a particular family, the
<i><span lang="la">Attidæ</span></i>, which has been placed by common consent at
the head of all the others, since, whilst structurally, and
in other respects, it is inferior to none, “it contains
among its 1,500 species the greatest amount of sexual
differentiation and the highest development of ornamentation.”
Dr. Wallace, after noticing “their immense
numbers, variety, and beauty,” in tropical South America,
<a id='Page_290'></a>says, “Many of them are so exquisitely coloured as to
resemble jewels rather than spiders”;<a id='r130'></a><a href='#f130' class='c016'><sup>[130]</sup></a> and again, in his
work on the Malay Archipelago, he alludes to them as
“perfect gems of beauty.”<a id='r131'></a><a href='#f131' class='c016'><sup>[131]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c017'>These little radiant spiders live amongst flowers and
foliage, and here they chase such small insects as their
size allows them to cope with. Besides running, they
make little leaps into the air, and so, if they can manage
it, come down on their prey, for which reason they are
often called “jumping spiders.” This is a very different
mode of action from that of remaining perfectly still
till a butterfly or other insect happens to settle on one,
and it is accordingly instructive to find that, great as is
the beauty of these flower-haunting spiders, yet it does
not resemble that of the flowers amongst which it is
displayed. The iridescent flashes and sparkles more
resemble those of the mineral than of the vegetable
world—where, indeed, they hardly exist—and must serve,
as well as their active movements, to point them out to
their enemies even amidst a background of flowers. It is
not upon principles of protection, therefore, or to acquire
a dissembling resemblance that such bright brilliancy has
been developed in these little creatures.</p>

<p class='c017'>Since, therefore, these spiders could not have become
beautiful on any principle of protective or aggressive
resemblance, nor yet of warning coloration, for which
there would here be no opening, and had yet become
beautiful in a high degree, they seemed to Professor and
Mrs. Peckham to offer a good subject for the testing
of the theory of sexual selection, and deciding as to
<a id='Page_291'></a>whether Darwin or Wallace was right in that matter.
After several months of careful, and often very laborious
observation—rewarded, however, by the most interesting
results—they have given their answer, and this answer,
resting as it does on the most irrefragable evidence,
should be decisive for all time. It may safely be asserted
that anyone who, after reading the “Peckham paper,” as
it may well be called, is not convinced both that the male
spiders of this beautiful family woo the females by
displaying their beauty before them, and that the females
carefully watch the display, accepting only such as please
them sufficiently and rejecting the others, never will be
convinced, since only by the spiders actually speaking,
which is not likely to happen, could the evidence be
bettered. If, indeed, the female had been heard to say
“Pretty i’ faith,” or “You are a fine young man,” just
before her actions gave clear, or still clearer indication
that this was in her mind, had she murmured “Take me”
as she let herself be taken, and had the male asked, after
the way common in novels, “Was it my abdomen or the
stripes on my palpi that made you first fall in love with
me?” then, perhaps, even those who believe that the
higher spiritual love is for man alone would have been
converted—and yet I know not, since assertions so unlikely
in themselves might have flung doubt on the whole
paper.</p>

<p class='c017'>But, however this may be, the evidence now offered us in
favour of Darwin’s views can never be strengthened except
in this way, so that, as far as proof is possible in such
a matter, sexual selection as a law and principal agent of
<a id='Page_292'></a>beauty in nature is now proved, though, at the same time,
several more facts are added to those upon which the
counter hypothesis seems based, and which would certainly
prove it in Topsy-turvydom. To take these first, the
authors of the paper in question have sought to apply to
spiders “the hypothesis that the brighter colour of the
male is due to his greater activity and vital force.”
“Beginning,” they say, “with the most brilliant family—the
<i><span lang="la">Attidæ</span></i>—we find that the females are, with few exceptions,
larger, stronger, and more pugnacious than the
males. Thus we placed two females of <i><span lang="la">Phidippus morsitans</span></i>
together in a glass jar. No sooner did they observe each
other than both prepared for battle. Eyeing each other
with a firm glance, they slowly advanced, and in a moment
were locked in deadly combat. Within a few seconds the
cephalothorax of one was pierced by the fang of the
other, and with a convulsive tremor it relaxed its hold
and fell dead. We placed together eight pairs in all, and
in each instance the fight was short and even to the death.
Subsequently we put in a well-developed male, which,
though smaller, was compactly built and apparently
strong enough to bring the virago to terms, but to our
surprise he seemed alarmed and retreated, trying to avoid
her. She, however, followed him up and finally killed
him.”<a id='r132'></a><a href='#f132' class='c016'><sup>[132]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c017'>So much for <i><span lang="la">Phidippus morsitans</span></i>. Coming to <i>Dendryphantes
elegans</i>, the authors, who kept a number
together in a large box, “were much struck by the
greater quarrelsomeness of the females. They would
frequently go out of their way to chase each other, and
<a id='Page_293'></a>they were much more circumspect in approaching each
other than were the males.”<a id='r133'></a><a href='#f133' class='c016'><sup>[133]</sup></a> Again they say, “Valkenaer,
Menge, Hentz, and others give numerous instances
where the male meets his death through the fierceness of
his mate. In fact the danger is so imminent that after
a successful courtship it is the habit in several genera
(<i>e.g.</i> <i><span lang="la">Epeira</span></i> and <i><span lang="la">Tegnaria</span></i>) for the male to retire with
precipitation from the web of the female as a reasonable
precaution; yet the rule is for the male to be more
‘beautified’ than the female.”<a href='#f133' class='c016'><sup>[133]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c017'>Coming now to the actual courtship of these brilliant
spiders, the authors placed pairs of several species in
square wooden boxes, having a cloth bottom, on which
they could easily move about. One of the species
experimented on was <i><span lang="la">Dendryphantes elegans</span></i> mentioned
only a moment ago—such a name is not to be forgotten—whose
beauty is thus described: “The male is covered
with iridescent scales, his general colour being green. In
the female the colouring is dark but iridescent, and in
certain lights has lovely rosy tints. In the sunlight both
shine with the metallic splendour of humming-birds.
The male alone has a superciliary fringe of hairs on
either side of his head, his first legs being also larger and
more adorned than those of his mate.”<a href='#f133' class='c016'><sup>[133]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c017'>Yet the extra vigour from which this special growth is
supposed to have sprung has not, as we shall see, affected
his growth in general. “The female is much larger, and
her loveliness is accompanied by an extreme irritability of
temper, which the male seems to regard as a constant
menace to his safety; but his eagerness being great
<a id='Page_294'></a>and his manner devoted and tender, he gradually overcomes
her opposition. Her change of mood is only
brought about after much patient courting on his part”.<a href='#f133' class='c016'><sup>[133]</sup></a>
And now comes the minutely interesting description
of this iridescent, <i><span lang="fr">couleur de rose</span></i> courtship. “While
from three to five inches distant from her he begins to
wave his plumy legs in a way that reminds one of a
windmill. She eyes him fiercely, and he keeps at the
proper distance for a long time. If he comes close she
dashes at him and he quickly retreats. Sometimes he
becomes bolder, and when within an inch pauses with
the first legs outstretched before him, not raised, as is
common in other species; the palpi also (in insects it
would be the antennæ) are held stiffly out in front,
with the points together. Again she drives him off,
and so the play continues. Now the male grows excited,
as he approaches her, and while still several inches away
whirls completely around and around; pausing, he runs
closer, and begins to make his abdomen quiver as he
stands on tiptoe in front of her. Prancing from side
to side, he grows bolder and bolder, while she seems
less fierce, and yielding to the excitement, lifts up her
magnificently coloured abdomen, holding it at one time
vertically and at another sideways to him. She no longer
rushes at him, but retreats a little as he approaches.
At last he comes close to her, lying flat, with his first legs
stretched out and quivering. With the tips of his front
legs he gently pats her; this seems to arouse the old
demon of resistance, and she drives him back. Again
and again he pats her, with a caressing movement,
<a id='Page_295'></a>gradually creeping nearer and nearer, which she now
permits without resistance,”<a href='#f133' class='c016'><sup>[133]</sup></a> and so on,</p>

</div>

<p class='c017'>Of the courtship of another species—<i>Habrocestum
splendens</i>—we have the following account: “The male, a
magnificent fellow when we first caught him, displayed
for a long time before the female. He began by advancing
a few inches before her, and then backing off again,
this being repeated many times. After a while he settled
down under a little web in the corner. The female,
troubled by this indifferent treatment, advanced towards
him; he came out and she fell back. This play was kept
up for some time, but at length the male began his courting
in earnest. When within a few inches of her he
began a rapid dance from side to side, raising the whole
body high on the tips of the legs, the first pair being
directed forward and the palpi clasped together, with the
abdomen turned to one side and lifted up. After a short
dance he stood motionless, striking an attitude and remaining
quiet for half a minute. Then he turned his
back on her, moving irregularly about, with his legs
forward and his palpi vibrating. Again he dances sideways
before her, strutting and showing off like a peacock,
or whirling around and around.”<a href='#f133' class='c016'><sup>[133]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c017'>On such occasions the female would “commonly move
nearer to him and appear much excited herself. We at
first supposed that this turning around was accidental,
<a id='Page_296'></a>but it happened so regularly at a certain stage of the
courtship that we concluded it was an important part
of the display, serving to better show off his brilliant
abdomen.”<a href='#f133' class='c016'><sup>[133]</sup></a> Of this there can hardly be a doubt, since
on every occasion the male spider, whatever his species,
assumed such attitudes as displayed his best points to the
best advantage—a fact which recalls the following passage
in one of Darwin’s letters: “I am very glad to hear of
your cases of the two sets of <i><span lang="la">Hesperiadæ</span></i> (a butterfly),
which display their wings differently, according to which
surface is coloured. I cannot believe that such display is
accidental or purposeless.”</p>

<p class='c017'>How glad, and more than glad, would Darwin have been
to have read the tale of these spiders! It is, indeed, one
of those ironies of fate, of which the world is so full, that
he did not live to see this demonstration—for it is no less—of
the truth of his most original and elevating views;
elevating they may be well called, since they allow to the
animal world an æsthetic faculty, the power, once thought
exclusively human, of appreciating beauty. It is curious
how willing many are to exalt humanity at the expense of
all other beings. The higher faculties they like, and
perception of the beautiful they like, and spirituality—especially
in love—they like very much indeed; but they
only like these things in their own species. That is
to say, conceit lies at the bottom of all this exaltation.
Such man-worshippers would not have more of a good
thing in the world, but less, so that they may have all
there is of it. On such grounds the war against evolution
was waged, and its last struggles are against sexual
<a id='Page_297'></a>selection. The body has been given up, but the spirit,
which touches us yet more nearly, is still fiercely defended.</p>

<p class='c017'>In <i><span lang="la">Hasarius Hoyi</span></i> “the sexes are very different, the male
being the more conspicuous of the two. In his dances,
the male has several movements. Most commonly he
goes from side to side, with his first legs obliquely up.
At other times he twists the abdomen to one side, and,
bending low on the other, goes first in one direction
for about two inches, and then, reversing, circles to the
opposite point. The females are very savage, especially
with each other, and even the members of the sterner sex
are not always free from danger when paying their
preparatory addresses. Once we saw a female eagerly
watching a prancing male, and, as he slowly approached
her, she raised her legs as if to strike him, but he, nothing
daunted by her unkindly reception of his attentions,
advanced even nearer, when she seized him and seemed to
hold him by the head for a minute—he struggling. At
last he freed himself and ran away.”<a href='#f133' class='c016'><sup>[133]</sup></a> Yet “this same
male, after a time, courted her successfully.” That so
much savagery has to be overcome in the female, and
finally is overcome by these dances, shows how powerfully
she must be affected by them. Of another and previously
undescribed species, “a dozen or more males, and about
half as many females,” were found by the authors
“assembled together” under natural conditions. “The
males were rushing hither and thither, dancing opposite
now one female and now another. Often two males met
each other, when a short passage of arms followed. The
<a id='Page_298'></a>males were very quarrelsome, and had frequent fights,
but we never found that they were injured. Indeed,
after having watched hundreds of seemingly terrible
battles between the males of this and other species, the
conclusion has been forced upon us that they are all
sham affairs, gotten up for the purpose of displaying
before the females, who commonly stand by, interested
spectators.”<a href='#f133' class='c016'><sup>[133]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c017'>Then there is a small ant-like species, who, “unlike
most of the <i><span lang="la">Attid</span></i> males, keeps all his feet on the ground
during his courtship. Raising himself on the tips of the
posterior six, he slightly inclines his head downwards
by bending his front legs, their convex surface being
always turned forward. His abdomen is lifted vertically,
so that it is at a right angle to the rest of his body. In
this position he sways from side to side. After a moment
he drops the abdomen, runs a few steps nearer the female,
and then tips his body and begins to sway again. Now
he runs in one direction, now in another, pausing every
few moments to rock from side to side and to bend
his brilliant legs, so that she may look full at them.”<a href='#f133' class='c016'><sup>[133]</sup></a>
What can be clearer than this? And here, indeed, the
authors remark: “We were much impressed by the fact
that the attitude taken by the males served perfectly
to show off their fine points to the female. We had never
known the male of this species until the day that we
caught this one and put him into the mating-box, and it
was while studying his courtship that we noticed how
he differed from the female in his iridescent first legs.
<a id='Page_299'></a>He could not have chosen a better position than the one
he took to make a display.”<a href='#f133' class='c016'><sup>[133]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c017'>Elsewhere, in another experiment with the same species,
the authors, after remarking that if these specially modified
front legs were held in any other way the effect of
the flattened and iridescent surface would be lost, go on
to say: “This is a good example of what we have again
and again observed in the courtship of the <i><span lang="la">Attidæ</span></i>: that
whatever fine points of colour or structure the male
possesses, his actions before the female display them to
the very best advantage. In whatever part the special
merit may lie, he sedulously strives to bring it to the
notice and impress its beauty upon the mind of the female
to whom he is paying his addresses.”<a href='#f133' class='c016'><sup>[133]</sup></a> As for the female,
she is throughout described as watching the male eagerly
and with the greatest interest, and that this interest is not
always felt from the first, but is aroused by degrees,
becoming, at last, so strong as to suspend for a time the
natural inclination to assault and eat the wooer, is all
the more significant. That there are dangers in these
courtships there has been some indication, “but worse
remains behind.” <i><span lang="la">Phidippus rufus</span></i> was caught once and
eaten in an unguarded moment, and whilst <i>Phidippus
morsitans</i> was waving his particularly handsome first pair
of legs, “thickly adorned with white hairs,” precisely the
same thing happened to him. Still, on the whole, such
incidents are exceptional.</p>

<p class='c017'>Particularly interesting is the account given of the
courtship of <i><span lang="la">Saitis pulex</span></i>, a male of which species was
introduced into a box already occupied by a female. “He
<a id='Page_300'></a>saw her as she stood perfectly still, twelve inches away;
the glance seemed to excite him, and he moved towards
her; when some four inches from her he stood still, and
then began the most remarkable performances that an
amorous male could offer to an admiring female. She
eyed him eagerly, changing her position from time to time,
so that he might be always in view. He, raising his whole
body on one side, by straightening out the legs, and
lowering it on the other by folding the first two pairs of
legs up and under, leant so far over as to be in danger of
losing his balance, which he only maintained by sidling
rapidly towards the lowered side. The palpus, too, on this
side, was turned back to correspond to the direction of
the legs nearest it. He moved in a semicircle for about
two inches, and then instantly reversed the position of
the legs and circled in the opposite direction, gradually
approaching nearer and nearer to the female. Now she
dashes towards him, while he, raising his first pair of legs,
extends them upward and forward as if to hold her off,
but withal slowly retreats. Again and again he circles
from side to side, she gazing towards him in a softer mood,
evidently admiring the grace of his antics. This is
repeated until we have counted one hundred and eleven
circles made by the ardent little male. Now he approaches
nearer and nearer, and when almost within
reach, whirls madly around and around her, she joining
and whirling with him in a giddy maze. Again he falls
back and resumes his semicircular motions with his body
tilted over; she, all excitement, lowers her head and
raises her body so that it is almost vertical; both draw
<a id='Page_301'></a>nearer”<a href='#f133' class='c016'><sup>[133]</sup></a>—and the male, now, for some short period is in
no danger of being eaten.</p>

<p class='c017'>Lastly—for this must be the last example—we have
a species—<i><span lang="la">Astia vittata</span></i>—in which the male is represented
by two differing forms, each of which dances before
the female in its own particular way. One of these forms
is red, like the female, which he resembles in other respects,
so that this must be taken as the original specific type.
The other, which has evidently been developed from it, in
deference to the æsthetic preferences of the female, is
black, with the special adornment of three tufts of hair
on his head, or thereabouts, that part of a spider which
is termed the cephalothorax. These tufts stick bolt upright,
rising together, but separating about half-way up,
and give to their fortunate possessor—for, as we shall see,
he is fortunate—a very spruce and dapper appearance.
Looked at dispassionately, if one can do that, they are
certainly as handsome as moustaches, and there is no
reason in the nature of things why they should not be
admired as much. So, indeed, they are, and that the
admiration bestowed upon each is of an equally high
nature I, at any rate, see no reason to doubt.</p>

<p class='c017'>The following description will show what a spider with
moustaches can achieve: “The <i><span lang="la">vittata</span></i> form, which is
quite like the female, when he approaches her raises his
first legs either so that they point forward or upward,
keeping his palpi stiffly outstretched, while the tip of his
abdomen is bent to the ground. This position he commonly
takes when three or four inches away. While he
retains this attitude he keeps curving and waving his legs
<a id='Page_302'></a>in a very curious manner. Frequently he raises only one
of the legs of the first pair, running all the time from side
to side. As he draws nearer to the female he lowers his
body to the ground, and, dropping his legs also, places
the two anterior pairs so that the tips touch in front, the
proximal joints being turned almost at a right angle to the
body. Now he glides in a semicircle before the female,
sometimes advancing, sometimes receding, until at last she
accepts his addresses. The <i><span lang="la">niger</span></i> form, evidently a later
development, is much the more lively of the two, and
whenever the two varieties were seen to compete for a
female the black one was successful.”<a href='#f133' class='c016'><sup>[133]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c017'>Here, surely, is a final answer to those assertions as to
indifference on the part of the female, which, though made
in the teeth of probability, are often, on account of the
difficulties of observation, almost impossible to disprove.
Here are two kinds of males, one lively and with moustaches,
the other not so lively and without them; as the
first is always, or even, say, generally chosen, his appearance
must be preferred. Were it only his liveliness, as
Dr. Wallace has suggested, why should he have acquired
another dress as well as another dance? or, if the female
can have a choice as between liveliness and slowness, as
between a jig and a minuet, why, in Heaven’s name, should
she not have one as between one get-up and another?
Sexual selection might, I think, be put to the test in this
one species with its two male forms. Let but a sufficient
number of courtships be observed and reported on, and if
<i><span lang="la">niger</span></i>, in a large percentage of them, wins the day, choice
on the part of the female—the only link in the chain of
<a id='Page_303'></a>evidence which it is at all possible to deny—is a proved
thing.</p>

<p class='c017'>But to continue: “He—<i><span lang="la">niger</span></i>—is bolder in his
manners (no wonder he prevails), and we have never seen
him assume the prone position, as the red form did, when
close to the female. He always held one or both of the
first legs high in the air, waving them wildly to and fro;
or when the female became excited, he stood perfectly
motionless before her, sometimes for a whole minute, seeming
to fascinate her by the power of his glance”<a href='#f133' class='c016'><sup>[133]</sup></a>—greatly
aided probably by the three tufts of hair showing through
the archway of the uplifted legs. Here, again, too, as in
some of the other species—perhaps all—“although the
males were continually waving their first legs at each
other, their quarrels were harmless. It was quite otherwise
with the females, since they not only kept the other
sex in awe of them, but not infrequently in their battles
killed each other.”<a href='#f133' class='c016'><sup>[133]</sup></a> As the males cannot win the females
by fighting, what have they to contend with effectively
except these curious, elaborate, and most interesting displays,
the purpose of which is so excessively obvious? On
the other hand, the fact that the females yield, almost
against their nature, to these displays, that they are
slowly and gradually won through their means, is proof
positive that they like them, and if so, how is it possible
that they should not like one more or less than another?
What, in fact, is choice but a greater or less reaction
to this stimulus or to that? The initial absurdity of
laying claim to a monopoly of such a capacity as this,
either in our matrimonial affairs, or any other matter
<a id='Page_304'></a>in which animals participate, has not been sufficiently
dwelt upon.</p>

<p class='c017'>Professor Poulton, in considering this case of <i>Astra
vittata</i> with its two male forms, one of which is always
chosen by the female in preference to the other, remarks
(with his own italics), “It must be admitted that these
facts afford the <i>strongest support</i> to the theory of Sexual
Selection.”<a id='r134'></a><a href='#f134' class='c016'><sup>[134]</sup></a> He thus endorses—as anyone, I think, not
hard-set the other way, must endorse—the opinion of the
authors of the paper that “in the <i><span lang="la">Attidæ</span></i> we have conclusive
evidence that the females pay close attention to
the love dances of the males, and also that they have not
only the power, but the will, to exercise a choice among
the suitors for their favour,”<a id='r135'></a><a href='#f135' class='c016'><sup>[135]</sup></a> to which he adds this rider:
“Remembering that this conclusion has only been reached
in the <i><span lang="la">Attidæ</span></i> by the closest study, I think we may safely
explain the smaller confidence with which we can speak of
other animals by the want of sufficiently careful and
systematic investigation.”</p>

<p class='c017'>The process of the narrative having led, in the last
chapter or two, to a discussion of some of the ways in
which insects become shaped and coloured through natural
selection, sexual selection seemed marked out as the subject
for this one. The reason why I have filled it with
extracts from a certain very interesting paper has been
a better one than that of saving myself trouble. That
paper—the most important one perhaps that has ever
been written on the subject—is a wonderful confirmation
of Darwin’s views, but Darwin, as it appears to me, has
not benefited by it in the way that he ought to do in the
<a id='Page_305'></a>popular mind. There is no work that I know of, written
upon merely popular lines, that brings these facts forward,
and yet I feel sure that to large numbers of people, who
yet do not care to read books avowedly scientific, they
must be extremely interesting, not only in themselves, but
as allowing them both to form a judgment on the subject,
and on the correctness or otherwise of Darwin’s views—for
Darwin is an interesting and picturesque figure far beyond
the close borough of science.</p>

<p class='c017'>Now the general more intelligent public who read,
perhaps, widely, but not very deeply or very specially,
know that Darwin believed in two forces—natural and
sexual selection—by the joint action of which, species, as
he held, had been gradually modified and evolved, and
they know that the former of these two has been accepted
by science, but that to the latter there has been much
more opposition, and that it is not—or is not supposed to
be—established like the other. Many, perhaps, may have
read Dr. Wallace’s <i>Darwinism</i>, a work in which Darwin’s
most distinctive and original view—that one whose conception,
apparently, he shared with nobody and on which
he based much of the argument contained in his <i>Descent
of Man</i>—is considered and rejected in a way which makes
the title of the book misleading, surely, if not a somewhat
comically ludicrous misnomer. All those who have read
it, as well as many who have not, will be interested—they
cannot fail to be—in the wonderful record of spider courtships
contained in these extracts, and having reflected on
them, they will, if I mistake not, be much more impressed
with the arguments <i>for</i> this part of Darwinism than they
<a id='Page_306'></a>were with those brought against it in the book of that
name.</p>

<p class='c017'>All these latter arguments, by the way—the languor of
swallows as against the vitality of parrots, trogons, etc.—were
well known to Darwin himself; and as no one was,
at the same time, more impartial in considering, and more
capable of correctly estimating, facts hostile to his own
theories, or which, at first sight, might seem to be so,
it may not be out of place to end this chapter with a
reference to what he thought of them. This we may
gather from a statement contained in a paper—the last,
presumably, ever written by him—which was read before
the Zoological Society but a few hours before his death,
and which is as follows: “I may, perhaps, be here
permitted to say that, after having carefully weighed,
to the best of my ability, the various arguments which
have been advanced against the principle of sexual
selection, I remain firmly convinced of its truth.”</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_2_0_4 c015'>NONE of the spiders mentioned in the last chapter
are web-makers. These latter are not dancers;
that is to say, the males do not dance before the
females when they wish to recommend themselves as
husbands. Instead, they pull at the strands of the web,
whilst stationed at its circumference, in a manner which
has a distinct meaning for the female, who sits in the
centre, and who replies by other twitches. These may
be either of an encouraging or repellent nature, and it
is only in the former case that the lover ventures to
approach. This, however, he must do with extreme
caution, and prepared at any moment to drop and hang
suspended by a thread should the object of his attentions,
who greatly exceeds him in size, change her mind or
conceive some cause of displeasure against him. Should
he not be sufficiently quick on such occasions, he is liable
to be spun up between the long legs of his lady-love as
though he were a fly, and disposed of accordingly. This
was observed in 1798 by Raymond Maria de Termayer,
<a id='Page_308'></a>who remarks upon it: “Perhaps overpowering hunger
compelled her to do it, but the act was very ferocious.”</p>

<p class='c017'>The most curious thing in these <i>webepathic</i> courtships,
as one may call them, is that the female spider seems
to know the particular jerk or twitch of any strand of
the web which is made by a male, and to distinguish it,
perfectly, from the vibrations set in motion by a fly or
other insect that enters it, for upon these occasions,
though her back may be turned towards her admirer, she
does not trouble to look round, whereas in the latter case
she would not only do so, but come rushing down to
secure her victim—if she were hungry, perhaps it should
be added. On the other hand, as has been already
mentioned, the male can interpret the wishes of the
female from the movement she imparts to the thread,
and regulates his conduct accordingly. Webepathy,
therefore, does not seem a name ill-chosen to describe
this system of intercommunication of ideas.</p>

<p class='c017'>The spider mentioned above as devouring her lover was
the common garden or geometric one, as it is sometimes
called, which in England is the largest example of a web-spinner.
In other parts of the world, however, web-spinning
spiders attain to a much larger size, and their
webs, of course, are in proportion. The largest, perhaps,
are found in Madagascar, and the gigantic fabrics which
many of these weave are curiously utilised by smaller
spiders of a parasitic disposition, who spin their own little
webs between the thick strands of those of their hosts.
Here they live in perfect amity with the latter, in whose
presence they find a protection against the attacks of
<a id='Page_309'></a>small birds—for these, it would seem, stand in awe of
these huge spiders, in whose toils they are sometimes
accidentally caught, and by whom they are then devoured.
So, at least, Vinson, the historian of the spiders
of Madagascar, would seem to imply, if he does not
actually make the statement, of which I will not be quite
sure.<a id='r136'></a><a href='#f136' class='c016'><sup>[136]</sup></a> That the great <i><span lang="es">Mygale</span></i> of South America eats
birds is now an established fact, Bates having given an
account of it in his well-known work, <i>The Naturalist on
the River Amazon</i>.<a id='r137'></a><a href='#f137' class='c016'><sup>[137]</sup></a> In this case also the birds—for there
were two of them—were caught in a web, but it was not
a geometric one, in which the spider sat, but a much
denser and more closely woven fabric stretched across
a crevice, or irregularity, in the trunk of a tree, the spider—which
was of much larger size than the largest <i><span lang="la">Epeira</span></i>—keeping
watch behind it in the recess.</p>

<p><span class='small'>A BIRD-CATCHING SPIDER’S WEB.</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c002'>This enormous Madagascar spider spins webs so strong that birds are caught and held in them.
In one of the large meshes will be seen a small parasitic spider’s web for catching flies and
other insects. The smaller spider is not only permitted to do this, but is protected by its
host from the attacks of the smaller birds.</p>

<p class='c015'>Other spiders—as doubtless the <i><span lang="es">Mygale</span></i> if he can get
them—will eat lizards, as the following account by Mr.
Frederick Pollock will show: “Having procured from the
Deserta Grande some fine specimens of this large and
handsome spider (<i><span lang="la">Lycosa</span></i>—a kind of tarantula) in the
early part of this year, and having provided suitable cages
with glass lids for them, I was anxious to ascertain how
large an animal the largest spider would take; and for
this purpose I obtained some lizards about three inches
long, including the tail. Three of these lizards were
killed and devoured by one spider during the time I kept
it. They were eaten bones and head and claws and all,
the only remnant of the feast being a small ball about
a quarter of an inch in diameter, which was cast aside
<a id='Page_310'></a>at the bottom of the cage.”<a id='r138'></a><a href='#f138' class='c016'><sup>[138]</sup></a> But why were not some
larger lizards tried, since there was no difficulty about
three inches? Every inch would have increased the fun—I
mean have added to the scientific interest. But perhaps
there were none larger.</p>

<p class='c017'>Mr. Pollock goes on to say that “the islands of Madeira,
Porto Santo, and Deserta Grande all lie within an area
about fifty miles across. They have each its own peculiar
large <i><span lang="la">Lycosa</span></i>, no two being alike; and it is a very remarkable
fact that these <i><span lang="la">Lycosæ</span></i> vary in size inversely with the
magnitude of the island on which they are found—Madeira,
the largest island, having the smallest <i><span lang="la">Lycosa</span></i>, and Deserta
Grande, the smallest island, having by far the largest
spider. The mode of defence of all these varieties of
<i><span lang="la">Lycosæ</span></i> is precisely the same. They elevate the thorax,
raise the first pair of legs high up, and opening wide
asunder their falces, strike at and seize any object, such
as the end of a pencil” (or the tail of a lizard) “in a most
formidable manner.”<a href='#f138' class='c016'><sup>[138]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c017'>There is another lizard-eating spider, or at least a
spider that will eat lizards when formally introduced to
them, and that in a very scientifically interesting manner,
the lizard showing such a lively sense of its situation, and
the jaws of the spider working in a way which is very
curious. These jaws, it appears, are double, also “cheliform,”
“denticulate,” and several other things, from which
I gather that there are two pairs, each pair working
something like the claws of a crab, but with a sawing
action, adapted to their toothed surface. By an extremely
beautiful adjustment, when the spider in question seizes
<a id='Page_311'></a>its prey, one pair of jaws holds on to it, whilst the other
saws into it, and then the pair which has been sawing,
holds, and the pair which has been holding, saws, and
so on alternately, a division, and yet, at the same time, a
combination of labour.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c018'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Like to a double cherry, seeming parted,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>But yet an union in partition.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c015'>The efficacy of the arrangement was well tested by an
Anglo-Indian scientist upon a lizard three inches long,
<i>exclusive</i> this time of the tail. “The spider sprang upon
it, and made a seizure immediately behind the shoulder.
The poor lizard struggled violently at first, rolling over
and over in its agony, but the spider kept firm hold, and
gradually sawed away with its double jaws into the very
entrails of its victim.”<a id='r139'></a><a href='#f139' class='c016'><sup>[139]</sup></a> There was an interesting variation
between this case and the last, where, it will be
remembered, the lizards were eaten “bones and head and
claws and all,” whereas here “the only parts <i>uneaten</i> were
the jaws and part of the skin.” This lizard, however,
was “at least five inches long from nose to extremity of
tail”; but then, again, the spider must have been larger
too, though clearly its meal was something in the nature
of a feat, since after it “it remained gorged and motionless
for about a fortnight, being much swollen and distended.”<a href='#f139' class='c016'><sup>[139]</sup></a>
There is no mention of this in the other case,
which would seem to imply that the result was different.
If so, we have here a fact of great interest—what fact,
scientifically elicited, is not?—but in order to establish
it upon a really firm basis, further experiments should be
<a id='Page_312'></a>made, and, once more, as the limit of size has evidently
not yet been reached, I would recommend a lizard of six
inches long.</p>

<p class='c017'>This spider, however, now I come to remember, is not
really one, but a <i><span lang="la">solpugid</span></i>, and a <i><span lang="la">solpugid</span></i> is a creature so
like a spider that it used to be thought one some years
ago, but now belongs, not only to a family, but to an
order of its own, which comes somewhere between the
scorpions and the true spiders. They are large creatures,
and their bite is very severe, though it does not appear
to be poisonous. Some of the species are nocturnal, as
is the case with the one above mentioned, which was
christened <i><span lang="la">Galeodes vorax</span></i> by its discoverer, Captain
Hutton, if he indeed discovered it. Captain Hutton,
being a great entomologist—to attain which title one has
only to put pins through insects—used to lay a sheet
on the ground at night, and stand a lantern upon it.
Numerous insects were attracted to the light, and this
brought <i><span lang="la">Galeodes</span></i>—who is a great entomologist too,
though without the pins—upon the <i><span lang="la">tapis</span></i> or <i>draps</i>.<a href='#f139' class='c016'><sup>[139]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c017'>Often there would be fights between two rivals, and
of these, or, rather, of the general fighting, and one
may also say yielding, habits of the species, Captain
Hutton gives the following somewhat curious account.
“They plant their true feet” (for these <i><span lang="la">Galeodes</span></i> have
a pair which look exactly like feet, but are really their
palpi) “firmly on the ground, the body at the same
time being elevated and the two pairs of palpi held
out in front, to ward off the attack. In this attitude
they advance and retire, according as either gains a
<a id='Page_313'></a>slight advantage, endeavouring to throw each other to
one side, so as to expose some vulnerable part or form
an opening for attack; and when this is once effected
the fortunate wrestler instantly takes advantage of it,
and rushing in, seizes his adversary behind the thorax,
and the combat is ended, the vanquished victim yielding
himself, without further struggle, to his inevitable fate.”
Similarly, “if, in their efforts to get away, they are
brought into contact, the one instantly seizes the other
and devours him, the victim making no struggle whatever;
but if they meet face to face they both enter into a
wrestling match for life or death.”</p>

<p class='c017'>This habit of yielding as soon as there is no more use
in struggling seems a very strange one, since it is opposed
to the primary instinct of self-preservation, and it is not
easy to see how the species can benefit by certain individuals
dying in a passive manner, unless, indeed, by
refusing to do so they might injure the victor, who,
by dying afterwards, would add to the tribal mortality.
If this be really the explanation, we are reminded of
Huber’s statement as to two queen bees, when each has it
in its power to sting the other, being seized with a sort of
horror, under the influence of which they separate, thus
avoiding the catastrophe of leaving the hive queenless.</p>

<p class='c017'>Though, as we have seen, there are some spiders which
eat birds, and others which eat lizards, yet both these
interesting things take place abroad. Here, however, in
England, it would seem that we have a spider which
eats worms, catching them at the end of a long woven
bag which descends into the earth, and into which the
<a id='Page_314'></a>worm somehow manages to get. How it does so, however,
is not at all clear, since the bag, which is sometimes
a foot long, is described as having no opening at either
end, the spider living enclosed in it, apparently a permanent
prisoner. Still a sac like this would seem as difficult
of entry for flies as for worms, and the spider, which
is three-quarters of an inch in length, and armed with
very large mandibles, or falces—to use the approved word—must,
it is plain, live on something. As a matter of
fact, it was living on a worm when found by Mr. Brown,
who gives the following account of the matter. “On
drawing out one of the sacs,” he says, “I observed a
worm at the lower end, partially within the sac and
partially outside, and it was evident that the spider
had been eating a considerable portion of its anterior
extremity.” One would have thought that a careful
examination of the way in which the worm had got into
the sac would have thrown light on the problem, but
of this we hear nothing more.</p>

<p class='c017'>When taken out of the ground the sac was limp and
flaccid, but afterwards the spider inflated it, and it was
then seen to have some minute valves—“openings,” that
is to say, “protected or covered by a little valve or door.”
They were not, however, to be detected in every nest—possibly
on account of their very small size. That the
object of these valvular openings is to admit air seems
obvious, for spiders breathe through lungs and require
a good supply of oxygen. It was now concluded, both
by Mr. Brown and Mr. Newman—a well-known entomologist—that
this particular spider lived on worms and
<a id='Page_315'></a>resided permanently in a long subterranean sac or bag,
which it had the power of inflating with air. A different
view, however, was propounded by Mr. Meade—an
authority on spiders—who suggested that the worm had
only got into the sac by accident, and that the spider,
like other subterranean nest-makers, probably came out
at night and fed abroad, returning to rest at home during
the daytime. To do this it would, indeed, have to unweave
one end of its sac—probably the upper one—and
then do it up again, but there was no reason, in Mr.
Meade’s opinion, why it should not act in this way. To
me, however, it seems unlikely that the minute valves,
made with such care, should be destroyed in this manner
and made afresh every day; and moreover, when Mr.
Brown looked again at the sac, in order to test this
theory, he could find no evidence of its having been dealt
with in this Penelopean manner. There were no traces
of fresh silk. The evidence, therefore, seems to be more
in favour of <i><span lang="la">Attipus sulzeri</span></i>—for that is its name—being a
genuine worm-eating spider. If so, it is worthy of all respect
as a curiously aberrant form.<a id='r140'></a><a href='#f140' class='c016'><sup>[140]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c017'>These spiders are of a deep brown colour, with a very
soft abdomen and a generally half-baked appearance, but
with hard, black, shining mandibles. There was only
a single individual—evidently the female—in the sacs
taken by Mr. Brown, but I myself was the finder of one
such sac—for I feel sure it must have been the same—in
<a id='Page_316'></a>the New Forest, and in this a pair were amicably settled,
one being about twice the size of the other. This, if
I mistake not, was in May, but I also remember, or seem
to, that the bag was quite open at one end. Thus, then,
stand the facts. Upon them I think we are justified
in believing that there is a worm-eating spider in England,
but of course it would be a very high honour for
any country to have such a creature, so that there is a
danger of letting one’s patriotic feelings run away with one.</p>

<p class='c017'>In these sac-making spiders we see, perhaps, the
ancestors of, or rather travellers towards, those which
crown a silk-lined perpendicular tunnel with a skilfully
made trap-door. The latter is furnished with a hinge,
and should it be discovered, the spider, seizing it from
within, endeavours with might and main to prevent its
being raised. As is well known, the upper surface of
these trap-doors, or, as we may call them, lids, are covered
by the spider with such materials—leaves, grass, moss,
etc.—as surround the site of its nest, so that when shut
down they are indistinguishable from the general surface
of the ground.</p>

<p class='c017'>Another use to which the webs of spiders are put is
that of a parachute, on which the little creature—for
small species alone may enjoy this luxury—sails delicately
through the air. This, however is not the nearest approach
made by any of the tribe to actual flight, though in
practice it almost surpasses that power, even as possessed
by many winged insects, who do indeed cleave the air,
but cannot ride upon it in a filmy chariot, twinkling in
the rays of the sun. Still there is one spider that, though
<a id='Page_317'></a>it has not yet achieved wings, is in process of developing
them. This little semi-Ariel—but the subject will be
best done justice to in the glowing language of the
Rev. O. P. Cambridge: “Adult male, length rather
above two lines. The abdomen is of an elongated oval
form, and rather flattened; its upper side is furnished
with an epidermis, which is continued, laterally, on either
side to an extent considerably exceeding the width of
the abdomen, and of a semi-oval or elliptical form; the
outer portion of this epidermis, on either side, is capable
of being depressed and folded round the abdomen, or
elevated and expanded to its full width, after the manner
of wings. Mr. H. H. B. Bradley, of Sydney, New South
Wales, to whom I am indebted for examples of this
exceedingly interesting and remarkable spider, tells me
that he has observed them elevating and depressing the
flaps, and also actually using them as wings or supporters
to sustain the length of their leaps. That this, as with
an analogous appendage in the flying squirrel, should be
intended for such sustentation one could have but little
doubt, after examining it even in the preserved specimens.
The three examples were all found on one spot near
Sydney, in the month of October, running and jumping
on low plants and flowers.”<a id='r141'></a><a href='#f141' class='c016'><sup>[141]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c017'>It is delightful to think of a little delicate spider-body
like this, rising gracefully from the petal of one flower,
expanding its thin, filmy fringes, and descending in a
long slanting line through the air, like a flying squirrel
or a galeopithecus, onto the petal of another. Even
were its appearance no more than elegant, this would be
a most pleasing sight. But it is much more than this.
<a id='Page_318'></a>Various hues meet in its diminutive body, and so harmonious
and pleasing is the general effect produced by
them that the first captor of so much loveliness was
enraptured as he gazed on his prize, whilst even Mr.
Cambridge, with only dried specimens to fire his imagination,
yet cannot choose but exclaim: “It is difficult to
describe adequately the great beauty of the colouring
of this spider.”<a href='#f141' class='c016'><sup>[141]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c017'>Spiders, then, either through gossamer or their own
structural modification, seem engaged in the conquest
of the air. There remains but the water, and this
element also they have partly subdued. There are raft-spiders
and diving-bell spiders. The first, having woven
a few dried leaves, stalks, grasses, etc., launches out as
courageously from the shore as the first navigator, whose
heart, according to Horace, was thrice bound in brass,
but who probably was timid and cautious. Our spider,
however, has no fears, nor need it to have any, since no
sort of capsizal can affect a structure which answers its
purpose as well one side up as another; whilst even if it
were to sink—though that hardly lies in its nature—there
is always the water to run on. The raft, in fact, is only
like the nest or web ashore—a place to have a comfortable
meal in. The prey—some aquatic insect—is caught
generally on the surface of the stream, and the spider,
after each successful raid, skims back with her booty to
the little self-guiding boat which it has temporarily left.
There, when no longer hungry, she sits and scuds about,
careless and pleasure-loving, like another little Phædria
in her “flitt barck” over the waters of the Idle Lake.<a id='r142'></a><a href='#f142' class='c016'><sup>[142]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c017'><a id='Page_319'></a>“Thus,” says Büchner, “everywhere in nature are
battle, craft, and ingenuity, all following the merciless
law of egoism, in order to maintain their own lives and
to destroy those of others.” In man, indeed, there is
some counterpoise to all this in the mind and <i>façon de
parler</i>; but the lower animals do not think so much, and,
having no proper language, cannot even talk altruistically.</p>

<p class='c017'>Lastly, we have the water-spider, whose little spun
nest, against the submerged stem of some aquatic plant,
is open at the bottom like a diving-bell, and filled with
air which its owner carries down from the surface in
successive bubbles, each one looking “like a globe of
quicksilver.” To collect them she swims on her back, and,
in some manner, entangles them amongst the numerous
hairs with which her abdomen is covered, where they
cling safely all through the journey,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c018'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Proud of that delicate lodgment.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c015'>There may be other bubbles as pretty, perhaps, but few, by
bursting, do such good to those who have cherished them.
In winter, it would seem, the spider closes the entrance
to the diving-bell, and sleeps, dry and soft, in a well-aired
bed, in spite of the damp situation.</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_2_0_4 c015'>SPIDERS having brought us to the water, it may be
as well, or even better, in view of the title of this
work, to say something about water-insects. Of
these, so long as the water be fresh, and not salt, there
are many, and the largest, perhaps, if he exceeds some of
the dragon-fly larvæ and the Giant Water-Bug of
America, must be the Great Water-Beetle—<i>Hydrophilus
piceus</i>—which is larger even than the much commoner
one—<i><span lang="la">Dytiscus</span></i>—which everybody knows, and which is <i>the</i>
water-beetle to most people.</p>

<p class='c017'>It is the fate of some animals to become associated for
all time in our minds with the name of some particular
man, as, for instance, the bee is with that of Huber, and
the ephemera with that of Swammerdam. Again, the
fame of Lyonnet, though he was skilled in eight languages,
and became cypher secretary and confidential
translator to the United Provinces of Holland, is principally
bound up with a certain caterpillar, viz. that of the
goat moth, of which creature, though only an amateur
in such matters, he made dissections and executed plates,
<a id='Page_321'></a>which have never yet been surpassed, and are supposed
to be entirely unsurpassable. In a lesser degree his
memory is associated with this particular water-beetle—the
great one, into the heart of whose mystery he was the
first to pierce: “In the beginning of July,” he tells us,
“I had noticed in the ditches a kind of cocoon which
I did not recognise. It was whitish, of the size of the end
of the finger, nearly spherical, but rather oval and
flattened. The surface, which looked like tow, was not
quite smooth. One of the two ends was flatter than
the other, and furnished with a raised rim. From the
space within this rim projected a sort of little tapering
mast about as long as the cocoon.”<a id='r143'></a><a href='#f143' class='c016'><sup>[143]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c017'>These cocoons, when opened, were found to contain
about a hundred eggs. Lyonnet kept them in water till
the eggs hatched. “The larvæ,” he says, when this had
taken place, “remained one day enclosed in the cocoon
before escaping. Then they made an oval aperture in the
lower part of the flattened end of the cocoon, and escaped
through this into the water.”<a href='#f143' class='c016'><sup>[143]</sup></a> Here they fed upon
snails, their manner of eating which is thus described:
“The larva seizes the snail with its mandibles, then bends
its body backwards and rests the snail upon the broad
back, which serves as a table (as with the larva of the grain-eating
ant of Texas). In this position, holding the snail
in its legs, the larva breaks the shell, and devours it.”<a href='#f143' class='c016'><sup>[143]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c017'>When full-fed the larvæ left the water, and one of them
was placed by Lyonnet in a box full of moistened earth.
This it entered, and, some days afterwards, changed into
a large white pupa or chrysalis, about which there was
<a id='Page_322'></a>one curious feature, viz. that “on each side of the head”—or,
as an entomologist would say nowadays, “on the fore
part of the prothorax—were three brown, strong hooks.
Two others of the same kind were found at the hinder end
of the body.”<a href='#f143' class='c016'><sup>[143]</sup></a> These hooks were solid, so that they could
contain no part of the perfect insect, and Lyonnet points
to them as good examples of <i>apparently</i> useless structures.
Their office, indeed, he himself knows, but he does not
reveal it till the usual philosopher has been imagined who
denies that they can have any. Then, of course, comes
the anticipated discomfiture of this unwary person—so
frequent in the eighteenth century—who, unwarned by
experience, has walked quietly into the trap. “In the
damp earth which the pupa requires the above-described
hooks fulfil a purpose, unexpected by us, but, at the same
time, of great importance. The skin of the pupa is very
delicate. Lying on damp earth, it could hardly escape
injury, and the weight of the body might easily give
it a distorted shape. But (<i><span lang="fr">Monsieur le Philosophe</span></i>) the
pupa protects itself from these dangers by assuming an
unusual attitude. It extends itself back downwards in a
horizontal position, and supports the weight of its body
by the three sets of hooks, as upon a tripod. In this
attitude, though surrounded on all sides by moist earth,
it keeps its body from actual contact with any object
until it has assumed its final shape. Thus,” continues
Lyonnet, turning full upon the stupefied philosopher, “we
see how necessary are those hooks, which at first sight
appeared so useless. To decide that this or that structure
is superfluous because we cannot guess its use is truly
<a id='Page_323'></a>ridiculous in beings whose information is so limited as
ours.”<a href='#f143' class='c016'><sup>[143]</sup></a> Applauding shouts (“<i><span lang="fr">Mais certainement!</span></i>” “<i>C’est
vrai cela!</i>”) rend the air, and the imaginary philosopher
goes out in a state of painful confusion.</p>

<p class='c017'>The above facts, first made known by Lyonnet, have
been confirmed by subsequent observers, such as Miger,
and the pupa of another and much smaller water-beetle
is now known to support itself in the same manner, or,
rather, on the same principle, since the place of hooks
at either extremity is taken by spiny projections, with
which the back is covered.</p>

<p class='c017'>Lyonnet now turned his attention to the mature beetle,
and especially to the female, whom he was anxious to see
make her cocoon. Having put a few in a large wooden
trough and supplied them with some floating weed,
“I had,” he says, “before long, the pleasure of seeing the
female <i><span lang="la">Hydrophilus</span></i> betake herself to work under my eyes.
I found, to my surprise, that, like the spider, she had her
spinneret at the hinder end of the body. Two small
brown prominences enclosed each a delicate conical tube,
from each of which a separate thread proceeded, and with
these the cocoon was woven in the following way. At
first, lying upside-down near the surface of the water, the
beetle buried the hinder part of her body, and the two
hindermost pairs of legs, in the weed, whilst with the first
pair, which were free, she drew and pressed the weed around
the end of her body, moulding it to its shape. She then
began to weave what seemed the under half of her
cocoon, but having finished this part she turned over with
it so that it became the upper half, and then wove the
<a id='Page_324'></a>real under one. The two curved surfaces were then woven
together, and in about an hour and a quarter the body of
the cocoon was finished. For about two hours after this
the beetle remained still, her back being uppermost.
At first her body was buried in the cocoon up to the
thorax, but one could see that she was gradually withdrawing
it. During these two hours of apparent rest she
laid her eggs, not at hazard, but in regular order, side by
side, the pointed ends uppermost. This work accomplished,
she closed the mouth of the cocoon, and then
began to spin the little mast, which gradually rose above
the surface of the water till it had attained the requisite
height, and the cocoon was then finished.”<a href='#f143' class='c016'><sup>[143]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c017'>Lyonnet was unable to discover the use of the so-called
mast, and it remains a mystery to this day, so that
the imaginary philosopher might have a better chance
here, were it not his <i><span lang="fr">métier</span></i> to be put to confusion. It
is hollow, and as the cocoon contains air, with which
the beetle supplies it—just as the water-spider does
her diving-bell—Miger, whose observations were made
in 1807, some fifty years after those of Lyonnet, supposed
it might serve as the channel of entry. But, although
hollow, it has no orifice, but is closed at the end, and this
does not seem to accord with the above view. Mr. G. A.
Laker, a modern observer, does not think that the spike
can serve as a balance to the cocoon, since this is usually
attached to some weed, or other supporting substance.
He, however, cut the spike off two of the cocoons, and the
eggs in both of these remained unhatched. Moreover,
these cocoons subsequently sank, whereas in their normal
state they “are so constructed that when floating loose
<a id='Page_325'></a>the spike retains its proper position, and even if the
cocoon be held so that the spike is parallel with the
water and then suddenly released, it immediately rights
itself.”<a id='r144'></a><a href='#f144' class='c016'><sup>[144]</sup></a> The balance theory, therefore, certainly seems to
have something in its favour. Lyonnet’s own conjecture
was that the mast, as he calls it—a designation against
which Miger protests—might merely represent the waste
silk which the beetle felt impelled to get rid of. The
time taken by the beetle in making the whole cocoon
is about five hours, whilst the mast, spike, or turned-up
point, as Miger severely calls it, takes it half an hour.
It is curious that whereas Lyonnet’s cocoons held “about
a hundred” eggs, Mr. Laker gives the number as “usually
between fifty and sixty.”<a href='#f144' class='c016'><sup>[144]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c017'>As space has its exigencies—and long may it continue
to have—I will here merely mention such names as
<i><span lang="la">Gyrinus</span></i>, <i><span lang="la">Dytiscus</span></i>, <i><span lang="la">Hydrobius</span></i>, <i><span lang="la">Donacia</span></i>, etc., “and let
<i>them</i> speak for me,” but having paid some attention to
the great water-beetle, silence in regard to the giant
water-bug would be hardly gracious, and might be ill
taken. This terrific creature is like a monstrous exaggeration
of our own water-scorpion, to which it bears a
distorted, but real resemblance, minus, however, the long
ovipositor—the so-called tail behind. Its appearance is
not to be described. Like other bugs, and as are the
aphides and cicadas for less cruel purposes, it is armed
with a long, sharp-pointed beak, through which, having
plunged it into the body of its prey, on whose back it has
previously leaped, it sucks the life-juices, holding on, all
the while, with its two curved, claw-like front legs. Its
<a id='Page_326'></a>strength is in accordance with its size, and both are such
that it finds no one in its own circle, so to speak, at all
capable of contending with it. “It is the facile master of
the ponds and estuaries of the tidal creeks and rivers of
the Atlantic States,” says Uhler. “Developing in the
quiet pools, secreting itself beneath stones or rubbish, it
watches the approach of a <i><span lang="la">Pomotis</span></i>, mud-minnow, frog, or
other small-sized tenant of the water, when it darts with
sudden rapidity upon its unprepared victim, grasps the
creature with its strong, clasping fore-legs, plunges its
deadly beak deep into the flesh, and proceeds with the
utmost coolness to leisurely suck its blood. A copious
supply of saliva is poured into the wound, and no doubt
aids in producing the paralysis which so speedily follows
its puncture in small creatures.”<a id='r145'></a><a href='#f145' class='c016'><sup>[145]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c017'>Another American water-bug of similar build, but much
smaller size, has the same general habits, to which it adds
the more special one of carrying about its eggs on its
back, where, in time, they are hatched, but do not, it
would appear—though this seems somewhat out of harmony
with the practical spirit of nature—proceed at once
to suck their parent’s blood, an omission which, as it
would be a most moving instance of unselfish surrender on
the part of the latter, is, perhaps, to be regretted.
Possibly the reason is that the eggs are not fixed upon
the right back, so that even were this <i><span lang="fr">dénouement</span></i> to take
place, we should not have an instance of maternal, but
only of paternal affection. This, for some reason, is not
so effective as the other, and therefore Nature, who, as we
know, is a consummate artist, may not care to waste her
materials on an inferior situation.</p>

<p class='c017'><a id='Page_327'></a>Be this as it may, the fact that the domestic economy of
these water-bugs did not proceed, throughout, upon the
lines that might have been expected may first have led
a German observer—Schmidt—to suspect something unusual,
in consequence of which misgiving he looked more
closely into the matter, and found—what had not before
been imagined—that the male and not the female was
the egg-bearer. He was not, however, able to determine
how this arrangement was brought about, or with what
feelings the male received and bore his burden. This was
left for Miss Slater, who found that the females in her
aquarium insisted upon laying their eggs on the backs of
the males, that the latter objected to their doing so,
which led to a struggle between the two, often lasting for
two or three hours, but ending invariably in the victory
of the female. The male has, then, to bow to necessity,
but he does not do so in a cheerful spirit, nor even without
some further efforts to escape his destiny. “That he
chafes under the burden,” says Miss Slater, “is unmistakable;
in fact my suspicions as to the sex of the egg-carrier
were first aroused by watching one in an aquarium
which was trying to free itself from its load of eggs, an
exhibition of a lack of maternal interest not to be
expected in a female carrying her own eggs. Generally
the <i><span lang="la">Zaithas</span></i> are very active, darting about with great
rapidity, but an egg-bearer remains quietly clinging to a
leaf, with the end of the abdomen just out of the water.
If attacked he meekly receives the blows, seemingly preferring
death (which, in several cases, was the result) to
the indignity of carrying and caring for the eggs.”<a href='#f145' class='c016'><sup>[145]</sup></a> This
last, however, is not very explicit, so that, the whole
<a id='Page_328'></a>account not being to hand, I cannot say what precisely
happened.</p>

<p class='c017'>It is curious that the male should be so spiritless, after
receiving the eggs, for this would seem to nullify such
advantages as the arrangement might otherwise offer.
The eggs must be laid somewhere, and might be supposed
safer on the back of the male than elsewhere—in which
fact, perhaps, we may see the origin of the instinct. But
if the male, sinking under his burden, is able neither to
defend himself nor it, this advantage seems nullified.</p>

<p class='c017'>Estuaries and tidal creeks, which, as we have seen, are
included in the habitat of these water-bugs—at least, of
the giant one—bring us gradually to the sea. That
there are marine insects we know, but they do not appear
to extend beyond the tidal beach, on the sands of which
they expatiate, when the sea is out, and burrow into
them on its return. All are small, and still smaller is
the amount said about them, even in such works as are
precisely those where all that is known on the subject
ought to be stated—systematic works of natural history,
for instance, which take “<i><span lang="la">Arthropoda</span></i> (Insects, etc.)” in
their due order, but do not so much as tell you whether
marine ones exist or not. Yet the date of such works
is after 1895. For these reasons, and another which has
been once or twice before alluded to, I have but one
remark to make about marine insects, and I will make
that in the next chapter.</p>

Merian’s statement—Contradictory evidence—A Chinese edict—Suggested

<p class='drop-capa0_2_0_4 c015'>NO marine insect—this is the remark—is phosphorescent—that
is to say, as far as I know, which is
a very saving clause indeed. This seems curious,
because, as everyone knows, other sea-dwelling creatures
are, producing most wonderful and beautiful effects, and,
moreover, the luminous property is active in many terrestrial
insects. Of these the glow-worm is a familiar and,
though, perhaps, the humblest, a very beautiful example.
At any rate, there are insects of the glow-worm family
whose fires are far less “ineffectual,” or, to speak more
truly, far outglow those of our own species. What, for
instance, can be more gorgeous than the green or orange
lights—for they differ in colour according to the sexes—with
which the nights and the rich vegetation of the West
Indies are brilliantly, yet softly, lit up? Nothing, surely,
if it be not the name of the creature producing such
splendour, which is <i><span lang="la">Pygolampis xanthophotis</span></i><a id='r146'></a><a href='#f146' class='c016'><sup>[146]</sup></a>—not one
syllable less.</p>

<p class='c017'><a id='Page_330'></a>Whether it is the male or the female that gives out
the green or the orange light, I do not know, nor in my
opinion do various monographists in various encyclopædias
and text-books, though they make no such avowal, but
content themselves with not saying. However, it is not a
matter of importance except to the insect producing it, in
whose breast the one or the other colour arouses very
different sensations—rivalry or love. For there is no
doubt now that these lovely illuminations, as well as
those of our own glow-worm and of every other light-bearing
creature, have relation to the needs and wants of
their producers, to whose æsthetic sense, and not to ours,
they are intended to appeal. That they appeal also to
our own is a mere irrelevant side-issue, not considered,
so to speak, by the force under whose pressure these
beauties were called forth, and not of the smallest consequence.
It was not always thought so, and were the
pride of man reachable by such considerations it might
humiliate us to reflect that displays, which in real beauty
immeasurably surpass our clumsy illuminations and fireworks,
are made nightly, not for our eyes, but for those of
a beetle.</p>

<p><span class='small'>INSECTS THAT CARRY LAMPS<br> The glow-worms in this picture are rather larger than life. The male insects have wings; it is the females chiefly, if not solely, that emit the soft, beautiful light.</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>Gilbert White, however, in the eighteenth century,
exclaims amidst some very pleasing verses:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c018'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“For see, the glow-worm lights her amorous fire!”<a id='r148'></a><a href='#f148' class='c016'><sup>[148]</sup></a></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c015'>on which one of his editors of the nineteenth remarks:
“This is still the generally received notion, but the fact
is that both sexes of the glow-worm are phosphorescent,
not only in the perfect insect, but also in the larva and
<a id='Page_331'></a>even pupa state.”<a id='r147'></a><a href='#f147' class='c016'><sup>[147]</sup></a> But this does not affect White’s
statement, which is the simple fact, as well as “the
generally received notion,” and, moreover, though our own
male glow-worm is phosphorescent, it is not so brilliantly
so as the female. Indeed, in the ninth edition of the
<i>Encyclopædia Britannica</i>—which is later than this editorial
note—it is stated not to be so at all, so that even if White
believed this—which is not very clear—he has been supported
by learned authority for a very long time.</p>

<p class='c017'>In other species the male is the more brilliant, or the
sexes do not differ greatly in this respect, each one
lighting its “amorous fire” in the degree that nature
allows it to—as no doubt our own male does too. Of
this fact, which, in the light of Darwinism, might have
been boldly assumed, there is no longer any doubt after
Professor Emery’s interesting observations<a id='r149'></a><a href='#f149' class='c016'><sup>[149]</sup></a> on the Italian
species <i><span lang="la">Luciola Italica</span></i>. These were made in the meadows
around Bologna, where, having caught some females,
the Professor imprisoned them in glass tubes and laid
them down amidst the grass. In this situation, though
smell as an attractive agent was excluded, males would
come flashing to the glass, and, on the other hand, as soon
as the lamp of any of these became visible, the female
would kindle her own, if it had previously been unlighted.
Arrived on the spot, the male would dash madly about
the unapproachable female, who continued to light her
lamp at him till another, and then others, arrived, when
it is to be supposed that her favours were distributed. In
the end there would sometimes be a dozen fiery rivals
glowing and flashing round the tube. But though the
<a id='Page_332'></a>female shot out her attractive beams with evident intent
to please, it does not appear that she was the seeker
in the business, since we hear only of males flying to the
imprisoned females, and not of females pursuing these
males. To such modest merit, therefore, as a nice distinction
between different ways of attaining the same end
may entitle her, the female glow-worm also is entitled.</p>

<p class='c017'>The light of the two sexes in the Italian glow-worm is
described by Professor Emery as being the same in colour
and intensity, but differing in some other respects. The
flashes of the male, for instance, are more quickly recurrent,
whilst those of the female gleam out at longer
intervals, but last for a longer time. They are, also,
more tremulous, as well as more restricted, though what is
meant by this last expression, since the brightness is said
to be equal, is not quite apparent. Possibly it may
imply that the light proceeds from a lesser area of the
body, but, if so, this should be clearly stated, even in
a <i><span lang="fr">résumé</span></i>. I can find no reference to such a fact, if it
be one, in the text-books.</p>

<p class='c017'>From the above it is evident that the glow-worm’s fires
are anything but “uneffectual” from the point of view of
the insect, but Shakespeare was no doubt thinking of
something very different—their paling, namely, before
the light of dawn. According to Gilbert White, however,
they should have been out long ago—the glow-worm
being too wise to afford opportunities of comparison in
this respect. Thus subtly does the naturalist of Selborne
impugn the accuracy of the Bard of Avon: “By
observing,” he says, “two glow-worms which were brought
<a id='Page_333'></a>from the field to the bank in the garden, it appeared to
us that these little creatures put out their lamps between
eleven and twelve, and shine no more for the rest of
the night.”<a href='#f149' class='c016'><sup>[149]</sup></a> The intention here, though cleverly disguised,
is not sufficiently so to escape detection. It was
possibly seen through by the late Charles and Mary
Cowden Clarke, who in one of the million or so notes
to their edition of Shakespeare, say, without distinct
reference to the passage in question:—“<i>Uneffectual.</i>
There is double signification included in this word; it
means the glow-worm’s light, which shines without giving
heat, and which no longer shows when morning appears.”<a id='r150'></a><a href='#f150' class='c016'><sup>[150]</sup></a>
Thus whilst not committing themselves to White’s opinion
they provide a safe refuge for their author, in case it
should prove in time to be correct; according to the sound
principle contained in a Russian proverb which says,
“Had he known where he was going to fall, he would have
laid down straw.”</p>

<p class='c017'>In tropical countries fire-flies take the place of glow-worms
with us, and though the light which these give out
is not so soft and poetic as the lovely green or golden
green one of the latter, yet it is more effectively beautiful,
owing to the way in which it wanders through the night,
appearing and disappearing in successive brilliant flashes.
For here the beetle that carries the lamp is a flier, and
flashes it about at pleasure through the air, having the
power, it would seem, either of showing or concealing its
light. The effect of a number of these points of brilliancy,
<a id='Page_334'></a>gleaming out, now here, now there, on the soft night air
of the tropics, is inexpressibly beautiful, as though, in
a smaller firmament, innumerable miniature stars had
ceaseless birth and death.</p>

<p class='c017'>Women, who like to emphasise their own beauty, or the
want of it, by placing themselves in juxtaposition with
every lovely thing in nature, and care not if a thousand
deaths go to help one smile or glance, have not forgotten
the fire-flies. They put them in their hair, or wire them
onto their dresses, threading them together, sometimes, in
long bands, which they wind about their fair—or otherwise—persons;
they do this, more especially, when going out
to parties, fancy-dress balls, or other social entertainments.
The advantages are obvious, for the homeliest
features may be thus lighted up, and the dullest woman
become brilliant. No wonder that in some South
American cities—Vera Cruz for example—these fire-fly
beetles form quite an important article of trade, all for
toilette purposes.<a id='r151'></a><a href='#f151' class='c016'><sup>[151]</sup></a> The natives catch them by waving
sticks with burning coals tied to their ends through the
air, by the light of which they are attracted, and so come
within reach of a long-handled butterfly net. When
caught, they are put into a box covered with a little
netting of wire, and there kept till wanted. They are
fed upon sugar-cane, and twice a day must be bathed in
tepid water.<a href='#f151' class='c016'><sup>[151]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c017'>What is done with the poor beetles after they have
contributed to the night’s amusement we are never told—whether
those that have been all wired together are
unwired and let go, or pulled off in two or more pieces
<a id='Page_335'></a>to save trouble, as seems more likely. It is likelier still
perhaps, in the houses of the rich, that the whole thing is
flung aside, and the poor living lamps left to struggle till
they die—unprovided with sugar-cane. But such details
are not thought worth mentioning. The charming effect
is the one thing dwelt upon, and charming it may very
well be, though to gain it through a mass of even insect
discomfort is, to my mind, a contemptible thing. Fancy
fifty or a hundred uncomfortable, writhing, struggling
things on the dress that a lady is dancing in, every one of
which, if let go, would make a wandering star in the air
more really worth looking at than the whole ball-room
together! By substituting flowers for women, however,
effects far more beautiful are gained through less reprehensible
means. The fire-beetles—why should they
be called flies?—are in this case confined in small globes
of delicate glass, set amidst clusters of flowers, or flowering
shrubs, and thus they softly illuminate the garden.
Give them some sugar-cane whilst the party is in progress,
and let them go next morning, and they will have had
very little to complain of—a strange experience for any
lower creature that gets into the clutches of the highest
one.</p>

<p class='c017'>The most wonderful of all the fire-beetles is the large
one of near two inches long—quite, or more, if we count
the antennæ—that inhabits Mexico, where in ancient
times it was used as a lantern by the Aztecs in their
night-journeys, as it still is by their modern descendants.
It is wonderful, not by reason of its size merely, or, in any
special degree, of the light it emits—though this is
<a id='Page_336'></a>brilliant in proportion to it—but because it carries three
separate lamps: two above, situated on either side of the
thorax, and one on the under side, just in front of the
abdomen. Thus, as it turns or varies in its flight, one
flash of the most intense brilliancy follows another, like
the revolving light of a lighthouse. The colour of the
light is described as a rich green—richest, however, or
at least brightest, on the under surface.<a href='#f151' class='c016'><sup>[151]</sup></a> The beauty
and dazzling effect of this upon a dark night can be
imagined, and is thus described by Dr. Kidder: “Before
retracing my steps I stood for a few moments looking
down into the Cimmerian blackness of the gulf before
me; and while thus gazing a luminous mass seemed to
start from the very centre. I watched it as it floated up,
revealing in its slow flight the long leaves of the palm
<i><span lang="la">Euterpe edulis</span></i>, and the minuter foliage of other trees. It
came directly towards me, lighting up the gloom around
with its three luminosities, which I could distinctly see.”<a href='#f151' class='c016'><sup>[151]</sup></a>
There is something wonderfully poetical in the thought
of winged beings like this pursuing each other through
the night, by the light of these glorious flashes—the
“light of their own loveliness,” it may well be called,
since it is, indeed, their beauty. If seems curious and
a waste that where there is the greatest capacity of poetic
imagination we should find the least, or almost the least,
realisation of it in habit and structure.</p>

<p class='c017'>We know from Oviedo that the Mexican Indians, when
they travelled at night, were accustomed to fasten these
great refulgent beetles on their hands and feet, and thus
pass flaming through the country. They danced, too, by
<a id='Page_337'></a>their light, and even wove or painted by it. Why, therefore,
could not lamps of great power, as well as beauty,
be evolved from such insects by bringing the selective
agency of man to bear upon them? The phosphorescent
principle in living nature has not perhaps been made the
most of by us. Was more made of it by the Aztecs? and
did they turn their attention to the systematic rearing of
these living lamps?—for, from hearing so little about them
one would not think that these insects were so useful now,
as, from the above account and what other contemporary
Spanish writers tell us, it would seem that they were, at
the time of this old and cruelly destroyed civilisation.</p>

<p class='c017'>Holder, in his work on phosphorescent animals, either
quotes or refers to Prescott as saying that “when the
Spaniards visited the country”—that is, Mexico, “the air
was filled with the <i><span lang="es">cucujo</span></i>, a species of large beetle which
emits an intense phosphoric light from its body strong
enough to enable one to read by. These wandering flies,
seen in the darkness of the night, were converted by the
excited imagination of the besieged into an army of matchlocks.”
Surely, from such a foundation, something as
superior to it as are our cultivated fruits, or domestic
breeds, to the wild stocks from which they sprung, might
in no long time be produced, since it is not to be supposed
but that some individuals of the <i><span lang="la">Pyrophorus</span></i> give a stronger
light than others. The above passage, by the way, if it
be from the <i>Conquest of Mexico</i>, as one might suppose it
to be, is most carefully concealed in the index, which,
however, it might very well be, and yet exist, as I know
from much teasing experience. As to the matchlocks,
<a id='Page_338'></a>would to Heaven the old Mexicans, as well as the Peruvians,
had had them, or, still better, 11-inch Howitzers. I might
then have something more to say about these wonderful
beetles. All I can add now is that the light appears to
be used by the insect as a guide to its own movements,
since when the celebrated Dr. Dubois covered one of the
side ones with wax, this caused the individual so treated
to walk in a curve, and when “both spots were covered it
soon stopped, and then moved in an uncertain manner,
carefully feeling the ground with its antennæ.”<a href='#f151' class='c016'><sup>[151]</sup></a> But I
do not know if “both” here means all three of the lamps,
or only the two upper ones.</p>

<p class='c017'>If there be any luminous insect that eclipses the <i><span lang="la">Pyrophorus</span></i>
it must be the great lantern-fly—also of South
America—provided only that the great lantern-fly <i>is</i>
luminous. That is a most essential point, and it does not
appear yet to have been satisfactorily made out. The
principal evidence on the affirmative side is that of
Madame Merian, who was right about the <i>Mygale</i>—the
great bird-killing spider—and who here speaks as an actual
eye-witness. Her account is as follows: “The Indians,”
she says, “once brought me, before I knew that they shone
at night, a large number of these lantern-flies, which I
shut up in a large wooden box. In the night they made
such a noise that I awoke in a fright, and ordered a light
to be brought, not knowing from whence the noise proceeded.
As soon as we found that it came from the box
we opened it, but were still more alarmed, and let it fall
to the ground in a fright at seeing a flame of fire come
out of it; and as many animals as came out, so many
<a id='Page_339'></a>flames of fire appeared. When we found this to be the
case we recovered from our fright, and again collected the
insects, highly admiring their splendid appearance.”<a href='#f151' class='c016'><sup>[151]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c017'>Here, then, is a definite statement, from which all
possibility of mistake seems excluded, if, as I suppose
is the case, there is no doubt as to the specific identity of
the insect which was the subject of it, and which is thus
described by Mr. Holder in the work already mentioned:
“The <i><span lang="la">Fulgora lanternaria</span></i> of South America,” he tells us,
“is nearly three and a half inches long from tip of head
to extremity of tail (<i>i.e.</i> abdomen), and almost five and a
half inches broad with its wings expanded.” Truly a
goodly insect, of right portly dimensions, and if it be
not really luminous—upon occasions, at any rate, for it
certainly is not so generally—it is so much the greater
pity. But to continue: “The body is of a lengthened
oval shape, while the head is distinguished by a singular
prolongation, which sometimes equals the rest of the
body in size.” This is a most remarkable appendage,
if it may be called so, hollow and with a blown-up,
inflated sort of look. It does, indeed, to some extent
resemble a Chinese lantern, and seems made to be
lighted up. The colour, too, suggests this, since it is
striped longitudinally with red and yellow, presenting
quite a gala appearance. Accordingly, it is said to be
here that the luminous property of this strange insect
exists. This is its lantern, and, by reason of it, it has
received its name of lantern-fly.</p>

<p class='c017'>And yet, since that night when Madame Merian had
her interesting experience, we meet with no one, apparently,
<a id='Page_340'></a>who can unequivocally say that he has seen the
Great Lantern-Fly with its lantern alight. On the other
hand, we have some second-hand statements which have
almost the value of first, such as that of M. Westmael, who
“assures us that a friend of his observed the luminosity”;<a href='#f151' class='c016'><sup>[151]</sup></a>
whilst “John C. Branner, <span class='fss'>PH.D.</span>, states that when in
South America he was often informed that it was
luminous, but never could find anyone who had personally
seen the light.”<a href='#f151' class='c016'><sup>[151]</sup></a> The curious thing is that there
are other lantern-flies belonging to other parts of the
world, and in regard to them too we have the same doubt
and discrepancy, the same assurances and general belief,
the same categorical denials. Thus a distinguished
authority on the subject of phosphorescence— Dr. Phipson—in
referring to the smaller Chinese species, <i>Fulgora
candelaria</i>—the candle-fly—says: “It is from these
appendages, the sides of which are transparent, that the
phosphoric light appears.” And again: “It is said also
that the trunk of a tree covered with numerous individuals
of <i><span lang="la">Fulgora candelaria</span></i>, some in movement, others in repose,
presents a very grand spectacle, impossible to
describe, but which may be witnessed sometimes in
China.”<a href='#f151' class='c016'><sup>[151]</sup></a> It would seem, too, that there exists a Chinese
edict which forbids young women to keep these candle-flies;
and if this is not with the idea of preventing
their use as signals, or of checking vanity, it is difficult
to see what the object of such an enactment can be.</p>

<p class='c017'>Lastly, we are told by Packard, in his <i>Guide to Insects</i>,
that “Mr. Caleb Cooke, of Salem, who resided several
years in Zanzibar, Africa, told me that the lantern-fly
<a id='Page_341'></a>is said by the native to be luminous. They state that the
long snout lights up in the night, and in describing it
say its head is like a lamp (<i>keetchwa kand-tah</i>).”</p>

<p class='c017'>All this evidence appears to me to point in one way,
and one way only—I mean, of course, in its entirety,
since otherwise it points in two ways. But even if it is
possible that in one country alone an insect—well known
and conspicuous—can have got the reputation of being
luminous without really being so, at least occasionally,
this can hardly have come about in regard to the same,
or some allied insect, in three or four countries. Added
to this we have Madame Merian’s direct evidence, but,
on the other hand, it is perfectly clear that these insects
are not always, or even generally, luminous. The conclusion,
then, seems irresistible that they occasionally are
so, that, for some reason or other, the phosphorescent
principle is active in them only at certain times or seasons.
Why this should be so we do not know, but there is
nothing inconceivable in it; and some other animals—for
instance, centipedes—would seem to be luminous at some
times and not at others.</p>

<p class='c017'>The so-called lantern or snout being a very remarkable
organ, for which some use must be assumed, the likelihood
of its sometimes becoming a lamp would be increased
considerably, if, so far as we knew, it performed no other
office. This was how the case stood till lately; but in
1899 there was the Skeat Expedition for scientific purposes
to the Malay Archipelago, and on its return Mr.
Nelson Annandale propounded a theory in regard to the
more ordinary use, at least, of the organ in question,
<a id='Page_342'></a>which was based on his own observation. His account
is as follows: “The curious anterior prolongation of the
head in many genera of the <i><span lang="la">Fulgoridæ</span></i> has long puzzled
entomologists. At Biserat, in Jalor, I was fortunate
enough to observe the real use of this peculiar structural
modification. On the morning of May 30th I noticed
a specimen of <i><span lang="la">Hotinus spinola</span></i> seated on the trunk of a
Durian tree in the village, and incautiously attempted
to catch it in my hand. The insect remained almost still,
merely drawing in its legs towards its body and pressing the
claws firmly against the bark, until I had almost touched
it. Then it lowered its head with very great rapidity,
flew up into the air without spreading its wings, and
alighted on the roof of a house six feet behind a tree,
and considerably higher than its position on the trunk
had been. At the time I did not notice anything peculiar
in the way in which this <i><span lang="la">Fulgorid</span></i> jumped, for there are
many large species of the same family which, without
being provided with long noses, can leap for a considerable
distance by means of their legs only; but as I was
examining my specimen (a dead one) I was struck by an
indentation or crease that ran across the central region
of the nose at right angles to its main axis. Then
I discovered that at this point, and at this point only,
it was flexible, and that if the tip of the nose and the
dorsal surface of the abdomen were pressed together
between the finger and thumb, and then suddenly released,
the insect would not fall straight to the ground,
but would be propelled for some distance through the
air before doing so, just as would be the case if a piece
of whalebone were treated in like manner.”<a id='r152'></a><a href='#f152' class='c016'><sup>[152]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c017'><a id='Page_343'></a>Mr. Annandale then goes on to show, or to suggest,
that the <i><span lang="la">Fulgorid</span></i>—as he calls it—by pressing its snout—or
lantern—against the tree-trunk, and at the same time
pushing itself off from it with its legs, “would fly into
the air at a tangent,” and he continues: “I have no doubt
that this is substantially what occurs in the case of
<i><span lang="la">Hotinus</span></i>; but in the living insect the action is far too
rapid for the eye to discriminate its details, and dead
specimens cannot be made to leap in this way because it is
impossible to force the legs to perform their part of the
action.”<a href='#f152' class='c016'><sup>[152]</sup></a> Such, then, is the theory, but as other members
of the family jump in much the same way, to all appearance,
without any such apparatus, and since the bending
of the head, at such a moment, might be correlated with
the movements requisite to produce such a leap as this, it
certainly wants confirmation.</p>

<p class='c017'>Some of the finest displays of luminosity have been
observed in centipedes, which although not insects, may be
counted such for the purpose of this volume. Thus
M. Audouin, noticing one night a light proceeding from
one of his chicory-fields, “ordered his man to turn up the
earth, when the scene that followed is described as truly
magnificent. The soil appeared as if it had been sprinkled
with molten gold, the display being intensified if the
insects were trodden upon or rubbed. In the latter case
streaks of light appeared, as if a bit of phosphorus had
been placed upon the hands, the light being distinctly
visible for twenty seconds.”<a id='r153'></a><a href='#f153' class='c016'><sup>[153]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c017'>Mr. Brodhurst, again, referring to another species—<i>Geophilus
electricus</i>—about an inch and a half in length,
<a id='Page_344'></a>and in the daytime inconspicuous enough, says: “The light
looked like moonlight, so bright was it through the trees.
It was a dark night, warm and sultry. Taking a letter,
I could read it. It resembled an electric light, and proceeded
from two centipedes and their trails. The light
illuminated the entire body of the animal, and seemed to
increase its diameter three times. It flashed along both
sides of the creature in sections, there being about six,
from head to tail, between which the light played, moving,
as it were, perpetually in two streams. The trail extended
one and a half feet from each centipede over the grass and
gravel walk, and it had the appearance of illuminated
mucus. On securing one of the creatures for examination,
I found on touching it the light was instantly extinguished.”<a href='#f153' class='c016'><sup>[153]</sup></a>
The display is, therefore, voluntary, nor
could Mr. Brodhurst ever get his centipedes to shine in
captivity.</p>

<p class='c014'>Scorpions and suicide—The act proved—Intention probable—Conflicting
evidence—Scorpions and cockroaches—Concentrating backwards—Economy
of poison—Decorous feeding.</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_2_0_4 c015'>THE assertion that scorpions are occasionally luminous—if
indeed it has ever been seriously made—does
not appear to have received confirmation.
Of fire, indeed, these creatures have a horror, but that
probably relates to its property—heat—to which they
are extremely sensitive. The popular belief is, that, if
surrounded by fire, a scorpion will deliberately sting itself
to death. Of the fact, or, at least, of the fact of the self-inflicted
sting, there can be little doubt, but in regard
to the motive there is room for difference of opinion.
Mr. Pocock says, truly enough, that it is <i><span lang="la">à priori</span></i> improbable
that the scorpion has any intention of killing
itself.<a id='r154'></a><a href='#f154' class='c016'><sup>[154]</sup></a> But what, then, is its intention in stinging itself,
supposing that it deliberately does so? Nor must it be
forgotten that the idea of death—of destruction—must
be indissolubly associated in the scorpion’s mind with the
use of its sting, since it uses it with that purpose only,
and that is the result which constantly attends its use.
Is it, then, really so improbable that it stings itself with
the same intention as that with which it stings other
creatures?—or, rather, with what other possible intention
can it do so, assuming the act to be a voluntary one?</p>

<p class='c017'><a id='Page_346'></a>Nor would it be necessary to prove the intention that
the sting, thus delivered, should be fatal in its effects,
and, in regard to this, Mr. Bourne has satisfied himself
by experiments with some Indian scorpions that a self-inflicted
wound, or even wounds inflicted by individuals of
the same species on one another, have no effect. On the
other hand, he found that a moderately high temperature
was fatal to his scorpions, and so concludes that this has
been the real cause of death in all such cases as we are
here considering.<a href='#f154' class='c016'><sup>[154]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c017'>The above theory, however, hardly accords with the
experience of Mr. W. G. Bidie, also of India, and that
very part of it where Mr. Bourne’s experiments were made—viz.
Madras. Writing to <i>Nature</i>, he says: “One
morning a servant brought me a large specimen of this
scorpion (the common black one of Southern India), which,
having stayed out too long in its nocturnal rambles, had
apparently got bewildered at daybreak and been unable
to find its way home. To keep it safe the creature was at
once put into a glazed entomological case. Having a few
leisure minutes in the course of the forenoon, I thought
I would see how my prisoner was getting on, and to have
a better view of it, the case was placed in a window in the
rays of the hot sun. The light and heat seemed to irritate
it very much, and this recalled to my mind a story which
I had read somewhere that a scorpion on being surrounded
with fire had committed suicide. I hesitated about subjecting
my pet to such a terrible ordeal, but taking a
common botanical lens, I focussed the rays of the sun on
its back” (so that Apollo may have flayed Marsyas as a
<a id='Page_347'></a>mild alternative). “The moment this was done it began
to run hurriedly about the case, hissing and spitting in a
very fierce way. This experiment was repeated some four
or five times with like results, but on trying it once again
the scorpion turned up its tail and plunged the sting,
quick as lightning, into its own back. The infliction of
the wound was followed by a sudden escape of fluid, and
a friend, standing by me, called out, ‘See! it has stung
itself: it is dead.’ And sure enough in less than half
a minute life was quite extinct.”</p>

<p class='c017'>This seems plain enough. The scorpion had not died
of the heat, up to the moment at which it stung itself—an
act which would require some vital energy. It did
sting itself, and in less than half a minute afterwards
it was dead. Moreover, as the experiments with the lens
were intermittent, there seems no more reason why the
last one should have been fatal than the other four
or five. It is, perhaps, possible to imagine that the
scorpion was almost dead before, that the last heating
caused it to expire, and that in the moment of doing
so it stung itself by involuntary muscular action. There
is nothing, however, in the narrative to suggest this, but
quite the contrary.</p>

<p class='c017'>Supposing the sting to have been a voluntary act, what
could the scorpion have intended except to injure itself?
Had it ever in its life used its sting with any other
purpose than that of doing injury? Mr. Bidie adds:
“I have written this brief note to show (1) that animals
may commit suicide; (2) that the poison of certain
animals may be destructive to themselves.”<a id='r155'></a><a href='#f155' class='c016'><sup>[155]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c017'><a id='Page_348'></a>Writing several years later, also to <i>Nature</i>, Dr. Allen
Thomson, <span class='fss'>F.R.S.</span>, gives the following account, not, indeed,
of his own experience, but that of an eye-witness in whom
he feels full confidence. He says: “While residing,
many years ago, during the summer months, at the baths
of Sulla, in Italy, in a somewhat damp locality, my
informant, together with the rest of the family, was much
annoyed by the frequent intrusion of small black scorpions
into the house, and their being secreted among the bedclothes,
in shoes, and other articles of dress. It thus
became necessary to be constantly on the watch for these
troublesome creatures, and to take means for their removal
and destruction. Having been informed by the
natives of the place that the scorpion would destroy itself
if exposed to a sudden light, my informant and her
friends soon became adepts in catching the scorpions and
disposing of them in the manner suggested. This consisted
in confining the animal under an inverted drinking-glass
or tumbler, below which a card was inserted, and
then, waiting till dark, suddenly bringing the light of
a candle near to the glass in which the animal was
confined. No sooner was this done than the scorpion
invariably showed signs of great excitement, running
round and round the interior of the tumbler with reckless
velocity for a number of times. This state having lasted
for a minute or more, the animal suddenly became quiet,
and, turning its tail on the hinder part of its body over its
back, brought its recurved sting down upon the middle
of the head, and, piercing it forcibly, in a few seconds
became quite motionless, and, in fact, quite dead. This
observation was repeated very frequently.”<a id='r156'></a><a href='#f156' class='c016'><sup>[156]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c017'><a id='Page_349'></a>Here, again, it is difficult to see how a mistake in
observation can have occurred, and admitting the facts to
be true, they go far beyond Mr. Bourne’s theory to
account for these phenomena, which, however, has been
adopted by Mr. Pocock, as the result of his own experiments.
In the first place, it is not here the heat—unless
by association of ideas—but the actual sight of the flame
that terrifies the scorpion, and death, apparently, is
inflicted as the result of that. Again, there can be no
doubt as to the self-inflicted stinging, and from the
manner of it, as well as its invariability, it seems to have
been deliberate. Whether death was the result of it
or not, we have the act, and the act, if a voluntary one,
must have implied a destructive intention. It hardly
seems possible, however, that the light of a candle, outside
a tumbler, though held near it, can in so short a time
have made the interior so hot as to kill the scorpion,
whilst, on the other hand, the poison from the creature’s
sting must have pierced its brain, and a few seconds
afterwards it was dead.</p>

<p class='c017'>If, then, we decide to disbelieve in the story of scorpions
committing suicide when unable to escape from fire, we
must explain away these two accounts, which we can
do by supposing the narrators to be either dishonest
or stupid. There is no other way that I can see, so
if neither of these do, we ought to believe the story.
However, there is plenty of evidence which points in
the opposite direction, and the advantage of this is that
we can take our choice.</p>

<p class='c017'>Scorpions are interesting animals to keep in captivity,
<a id='Page_350'></a>and their habits under these conditions have been carefully
studied by Mr. Pocock.<a href='#f154' class='c016'><sup>[154]</sup></a> When supplied with sand they
dig pits in it, in which they lie during the greater part of
the day. The second and third pairs of legs are used for
this purpose, the scorpion raising itself upon the other
two pairs, as well as, to a certain extent, upon the claws
and the end of the tail. In this position it kicks the
sand backwards from under it, and then when the excavation
is sufficiently deep, sweeps away the accumulated
heap, with its tail, so that the edge of its lurking-place is
on a level with the surrounding surface. It can thus, as
it lies there, obtain an uninterrupted view, which the
better enables it to receive with proper attention any
creature of the requisite size and quality that approaches
its portals. Such creatures are principally insects, spiders,
centipedes, wood-lice, and the like—but here we may
remember one little spider that imitates a scorpion, and
may therefore approach with impunity, at least if the
disparity in size be not too great, for whilst some scorpions
are quite small, others attain a length of eight or
nine inches, with a bulk more than in proportion to their
length.</p>

<p class='c017'>In captivity, and, no doubt, under nature too, when
they happen to come across them, scorpions will eat cockroaches,
but a cockroach is not altogether a defenceless
creature, and sometimes a large one will give battle, and
even with success. The weapons upon which, in these
cases, it relies are its powerful hind legs armed, as they
are, with spines which project backwards. Backwards
accordingly it advances upon the scorpion, and increasing
<a id='Page_351'></a>its pace suddenly, when at the requisite distance salutes
the astonished enemy with a shower of kicks. So unexpected
is this mode of assault that it is sometimes
effective, even against so redoubtable an opponent as
a scorpion, whilst a tarantula spider has been known to
fly, panic-stricken, before or rather behind a large cockroach.
But such efforts, however heroic, can have only
a transient success, where the conditions are so unequal.
Jaws and sting must prevail against soft bodies armed
only with spiny legs. “<i><span lang="it">Alla stoccata</span></i> carries it away.”
Generally the poor cockroach is seized—sometimes, in the
first instance, by the antennæ—as it comes inadvertently
too near to the scorpion, or even trespasses upon its back.
At once the tail is bent above it, and the fatal sting
enters its body. Paralysis ensues, and would no doubt be
quickly followed by death, even were the scorpion, thereupon,
to retire. As it is, however, it is difficult to say
whether the victim dies more of the sting or of being
eaten.</p>

<p class='c017'>From the latter process, at any rate, there is no recovery,
as may be seen in the case of smaller cockroaches,
upon whom the scorpion, from motives of economy, does
not always waste its poison. It merely, when thus
provident, holds the contemptible creature in its claws,
whilst bringing to bear upon it its two pairs of chelæ or
real jaws, which act upon the same principle as those of
<i><span lang="la">Galeodes vorax</span></i>, if the reader remember. It feeds in a
leisurely manner, the impatience of the cockroach not
affecting it in the least. Two hours for a good-sized
one—a <i><span lang="fr">pièce de résistance</span></i>—is not considered too long by
the scorpion.</p>

<p class='c017'><a id='Page_352'></a>Scorpions, it appears, use their stings in a very careful,
deliberate manner. It is not a mere random thrust with
them, lunged in anywhere, just as the body of an insect
happens to come. On the contrary, they feel about this
body, most anxiously, with their tail, till they have found
a soft spot in it, and then introduce their sting in a
careful manner. In fact, they sting an insect in much the
way that Isaak Walton impaled a frog upon the hook—“tenderly
as if they loved him”—and for the same class
of reason, viz. to make a workmanlike job of it, and not
break their stings against the harder parts of its body,
for the point of this weapon is delicate and might get
chipped against the hard shards of a beetle, or other such
resisting surface.</p>

<p class='c017'>For the same prudent reason the tail is carried aloft,
over the scorpion’s back, when it walks, so that the whole
organ, but especially the point of it, which is curled
round again underneath, is preserved from contact with
the outer world. The sting, or rather the sides of the
poison vesicle just above it, are clothed with hairs, which
are, no doubt, delicately tactile, and the same may be
said of the tail and various other parts of the body.
Touch, indeed, is the principal sense which conveys impressions
to the soul of the scorpion. Sight is defective,
and hearing does not seem to exist.</p>

least formulated in writing, the idea of natural selection; but Aristotle,
as is usual in such cases, had anticipated him as well as Darwin,
Wallace, and one or two others, and that in a very unmistakable
